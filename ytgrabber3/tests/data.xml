in</text><text start="3.88" dur="4.59">they want to take away from the people that
have invested and rooted their heart</text><text start="8.47" dur="3.169">and souls into this community to</text><text start="11.639" dur="2.97">maybe bring more lucrative</text><text start="14.609" dur="1.32">companies into town.</text><text start="15.929" dur="6.52">We fixed up the place and we made a gun store
into a youth center providing hope</text><text start="22.449" dur="3">for inner city kids; that&amp;#39;s redevelopment.  </text><text start="39.2" dur="2.8">Rather than complain about the problems in our
community,</text><text start="42" dur="2.52">we decided to do something about it.</text><text start="44.52" dur="2.22">We put up two punching bags</text><text start="46.74" dur="3.55">and we just went after it in the back yard of
my house.  It was really interesting-we started</text><text start="50.29" dur="1.86">this program</text><text start="52.15" dur="2.06">to fight juvenile delinquency</text><text start="54.21" dur="3.52">with the boxing, it was a two-fold success story:</text><text start="57.73" dur="2.43">providing juvenile diversion and fighting</text><text start="60.16" dur="2.44">childhood obesity in the latino community.</text><text start="62.6" dur="4.81">Here in National City one of the lowest income
neighborhoods in San Diego we&amp;#39;re providing a</text><text start="67.41" dur="2.21">resource and a center free of charge</text><text start="69.62" dur="2.18">to low-income kids</text><text start="71.8" dur="3.9">and we&amp;#39;re going, we&amp;#39;re combating against playstation
and hanging out in the house and we&amp;#39;re getting</text><text start="75.7" dur="1.95">the kids out,</text><text start="77.65" dur="2.17">we&amp;#39;re running and doing some good things.</text><text start="79.82" dur="3.76">-I get physically fit, I stay mentally focused it helps me stay</text><text start="83.58" dur="3.56">coordinated in school.  Exercise like this is not easy, it&amp;#39;s
discipline.</text><text start="87.14" dur="4.62">-We started out with one punching bag in the backyard of our house, 
progressed to a small</text><text start="91.76" dur="3.73">gymnasium on the outskirts of National City,
and then with the help of a board of directors</text><text start="95.49" dur="4.46">and help of the supporters we were able to get 
the facility where we&amp;#39;re at right now.</text><text start="99.95" dur="2.97">It&amp;#39;s easy access to the buses to the trolleys.</text><text start="102.92" dur="3.62">A kid just picks up his bike and rides right in
and so it&amp;#39;s really important that you</text><text start="106.54" dur="0.58">know</text><text start="107.12" dur="4.79">we&amp;#39;re located here in the heart
of National City. 
-In 2007 National</text><text start="111.91" dur="3.01">City declared almost 700 properties
blighted</text><text start="114.92" dur="4.83">in order to be able to use eminent domain
against them for constitutionally <i>illegitimate</i></text><text start="119.75" dur="6.25">purposes.
-It is our property, we&amp;#39;ve invested into
it and for somebody else to say that your</text><text start="126" dur="1.16">property</text><text start="127.16" dur="1.719">is blighted</text><text start="128.879" dur="6.13">just because they have a different idea of what
they want to do and say that you have to move</text><text start="135.009" dur="1.26">is wrong.</text><text start="136.269" dur="1.581">-National City&amp;#39;s blight designation</text><text start="137.85" dur="1.549">is a sham.</text><text start="139.399" dur="5.16">-National City had decided to declare 700
properties blighted before it even did</text><text start="144.559" dur="2.67">its blight study.  
-What we have here</text><text start="147.229" dur="5.65">is eminent domain being used to give to a
wealthier landowner so he can rake in some</text><text start="152.879" dur="4.38">bucks on the jeopardy of the backs
of these kids, and that&amp;#39;s where the problem</text><text start="157.259" dur="5.44">lies. Since we&amp;#39;ve been here for so long it&amp;#39;s
become a part of growing up in National City</text><text start="162.699" dur="3.24">to come through a program like this.  A kid
can come in</text><text start="165.939" dur="1.101">free of charge,</text><text start="167.04" dur="1.45">they could go to school,</text><text start="168.49" dur="3.789">and get some tutoring; boxing is just the actual
hook,</text><text start="172.279" dur="2.641">it&amp;#39;s the actual avenue to get these kids</text><text start="174.92" dur="3.229">into school.  A lot of these young people that come
to </text><text start="178.149" dur="2.88">our school is through a juvenile court community school.</text><text start="181.029" dur="2.64">They&amp;#39;re removed from actual public schools</text><text start="183.669" dur="4.42">They&amp;#39;re involved with the foster system,
the juvenile probation department and so they</text><text start="188.089" dur="4.281">come to our school.  They get their grades up,
they get the credits up,</text><text start="192.37" dur="4.81">and they&amp;#39;re transitioned back into actual
regular public school.  And what&amp;#39;s happening</text><text start="197.18" dur="3.309">in the transformations that are happening that
kids came in</text><text start="200.489" dur="4.851">that were doing some bad things in the community
now are police officers, now they&amp;#39;re going on to</text><text start="205.34" dur="5.629">college, now they want to be attorneys and
what we&amp;#39;re doing is just providing and using</text><text start="210.969" dur="5.12">the sport of boxing to get these kids to school
and with the help of IJ</text><text start="216.089" dur="4.671">has brought education even to the kids about eminent
domain.
-Many of the kids at CYAC</text><text start="220.76" dur="1.11">are troubled,</text><text start="221.87" dur="1.429">at-risk kids</text><text start="223.299" dur="3.46">but every day they&amp;#39;re fighting for their own
American dream</text><text start="226.759" dur="4.63">and they&amp;#39;ve inspired us to come out and fight
for them. 
-For IJ to step aboard and support</text><text start="231.389" dur="4.37">us in this situation that we&amp;#39;re in is a lot
of help because we would&amp;#39;ve never been able to do</text><text start="235.759" dur="1.49">it by ourselves.</text><text start="237.249" dur="1.52">-To me it&amp;#39;s sad because right</text><text start="238.769" dur="4.951">here in National City, we don&amp;#39;t have that many programs
that help kids out.  Why would you take down</text><text start="243.72" dur="4.049">something that is good for the community?
-We have decided not to move.</text><text start="247.769" dur="1.911">If this was to be a park,</text><text start="249.68" dur="2">if this was to be a library, a road</text><text start="251.68" dur="4.299">that everybody can use then that would be
a public use to me.</text><text start="255.979" dur="4.98">But to build actual luxury condos, that is
wrong. 
Using eminent domain</text><text start="260.959" dur="2.841">and bogus blight designations to transfer property</text><text start="263.8" dur="2.149">from people of modest means to</text><text start="265.949" dur="4.701">wealthy people is unconstitutional, and it&amp;#39;s
illegal under California law. 
-So we&amp;#39;re gonna</text><text start="270.65" dur="2.649">work hard to stay where we&amp;#39;re at</text><text start="273.299" dur="3.721">and keep on working for our goal
and objective and that&amp;#39;s reaching</text><text start="277.02" dur="0.429">kids in our community.  </text></transcript>
