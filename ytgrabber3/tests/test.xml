	<title>Driving Sports TV - Sport Sedan Shootout: Mitsubishi, Acura, Audi</title>
	<captions>
		<caption start="47">On this episode of Driving Sports: We&#39;ll compare three all-wheel drive sport sedans on one of the greatest roads in America. Jessie goes really fast in an Acura TL. Aaron feels the power of an Audi S4.  And I get to shred the tires on a Mitsubishi Evolution MR.</caption>
		<caption start="73">But first, let&#39;stake a closer look at each car. Starting with Jessie and the TL. Already taking in the best, of California wine country. Compared to the other two sedans it will face off against later, this 2011 Acura TL may seem rather bland,  mundane even. But, where the S4 and the Evo are essentially toys for overgrown boys.</caption>
		<caption start="98">The Acura is more sophsiticatedmaking it quite at home in a setting like this this particular TL is loaded with the tech package, a 305-horsepower V6 and an all-wheel drive option that rivals both the  Audi and Mitsubishi systems. Inside, the traditional Acura interior. Many driver options, lots of buttons it&#39;s a contemporary and comfortable package.</caption>
		<caption start="123">The surpriseis that this model is equipped with a close-ratio six-speed manual transmission which is unusual for any luxury sedan. Outside the Acura TL has a look that&#39;s unique, but polarizing. &quot;It&#39;s not downright offensive, but if you keep walking around it you eventually find an angle that&#39;s... pretty good.</caption>
		<caption start="151">undefined Talk about bringing a knife to a gunfight, that TL is totally-outclassedby the cars Ryan and I are testing near mount Shasta undefined Okay, hold the wine and cheese, this is what a real sport sedan craves smooth pavement and tight corners. and today I have just the car for a road like this.  This is the 2011 Lancer Evolution MR Touring.</caption>
		<caption start="176">It is, what you could call, the &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; of the Lancer family of cars under that lightweight aluminum hood  an angry, slobbering brute of an inline 4.</caption>
		<caption start="201">This monster puts out 291-horsepower and 300 ft-lbs of torque through Mitsubishi&#39;s rally-inspired all-wheel drive system undefinedNow you may be asking yourself, how do they get that much power out of something no bigger than a Coke bottle, to this I answer, with a big, beefy, twin-scroll turbo. Hit the power and... wait for it... yeah! It&#39;s like dropping a entire roll of Mentos into a bottle of Cola.</caption>
		<caption start="226"> The Evo is a great choice for thekids, but the car I&#39;m driving is the big-daddy of all-wheel drive sport sedans. I&#39;m talking of course about the Audi S4 under the hood is Audi&#39;s 3-liter all-aluminum TFSI V6 it&#39;s supercharged for 333-horsepower and 325 ft-lbs of torque. That&#39;s significantly more powerful than either the TL or the Evo.  It&#39;s more expensive too.</caption>
		<caption start="251">This &quot;Prestige&quot; model starts at$53,500. But that doesn&#39;t just give you a fast car it gets a comfortable one, too. Compared to Audi&#39;s standard A4, the S-edition gives an extra dash of adrenaline to the already swank appointments. undefined The Evolution is, in many ways the brother of the S4... from another mother.</caption>
		<caption start="276">both cars started off in their embryonic beginnings as stripped-down rally monsters Audi, made its way through the rocky path of acquisitions,  to the premium segment. Mitsubishi stayed truer to its roots and made improvements through technology. It&#39;s hard to argue that that this isn&#39; an amazing car... because it is.</caption>
		<caption start="301">But take a closer look. That really cool DSG transmission? It&#39;s not unique to the  S4. The Evolution has one also. But where the Evolution has six short ratios, the S4 has seven long ones.  And seven is better. Right? Actually, Aaron, you&#39;re wrong. A stick-shift like this Acura TL is the best choice. But it wasn&#39;t always an option for this car.</caption>
		<caption start="330">Okay so, until 2010, if you wanted a TL you had to settle on Acuras 5-speedautomatic transmission. And I&#39;m not talking about a fancy dual-clutch box either. I&#39;m talking about a Hydromatic-style, slushy, sloppy  drive. It was, quite frankly, an unacceptible state of affairs.</caption>
		<caption start="358">Thankfully, in 2010 Acura finally stepped up to a proper 6-speed manual transmission I wonder if Ryan has crashed his test car yet? Aaron may be underestimating this Mitsubishi, it&#39;s much more than just a rally-inspiredall-wheel drive system bolted to a hairy-chested turbo 4. You know the real magic in this Evolution is something far less primal. It&#39;s this twin-clutch gearbox, which Mitsubishi calls its  twin-clutch sport shift transmission.</caption>
		<caption start="383">Instead of running power through a sloppy torque-converter like traditional automatic transmissions, this close-ratio six-speedunit uses what is, essentially, two 3-speed manual transmissions, side-by-side Hit this lever here and the electro-hydraulic actuator pings back and forth as it moves up and down through the gears. This is very similar to the gearbox used in the Lamborghini Gallardo and the  Audi R8, but that&#39;s a test for another day.</caption>
		<caption start="408">Of course, just one look at the exterior of this Evolution and my supercar metaphor starts to fall apart. Where most supercars will take  you from 0 to laid in about 3-seconds, the exterior of this  Evolution isn&#39;t likely to attract the fairer sex. If that is, indeed, your  aim. Inside, same story, it&#39;s all business. But the Evolution isn&#39;t a car that you stand around admiring all day. It&#39;s meant to be driven.</caption>
		<caption start="433">And, since it&#39;s not as expensive as a Gallardo the occasional tail-slapper, road rash,  paint chip, it&#39;s just not that big of a deal.</caption>
		<caption start="458">undefined undefined Well, I acutally feel pretty badabout that. What&#39;s this?  We found these up the road. Look, it&#39;s all the pop-rivets that came off for the underbody pieces. We&#39;ll see if we can get these back on... and move on to the next scene.</caption>
		<caption start="483">As we pushed North Ryan found me on the freeway, and before long we were comparing the Evo and the S4 side-by-side3-2-1 Go! undefined undefined And I shift.  undefined Shift. Pretty impressive. Pretty impressive.</caption>
		<caption start="508">I think that when you actually floor it and we actually get our timing right, it&#39;s not that ...you&#39;re not that fast off the line. But you definately have more power throughout the band there. Well, we&#39;ve established that from a 4th gear clutch-dump the  Audi S4 trumps the Mitsubishi. But the Mitsubishi really holds its own with its interior.</caption>
		<caption start="533">Okay, no, it doesn&#39;t at all. Now the final test. With more horsepower under hood, this S4 should be able to dominate this Evo on any serpentine road.  Now it&#39;s time to do just that. An epic battle for all time.  Pitting Germany against Japan. The Audi S4 verus the Mitsubishi Evolution. Versus the Acura TL.</caption>
		<caption start="558">What? Think I was going to let you guys have all the fun? Hecks no! So, Jess, do you think your has any chance against our cars? I mean, really? You know, I think... there could be a chance. Yeah, but your suspension is a little softer. Your motors... just not.. I mean... both of our cars are racing machines.</caption>
		<caption start="583">Your car, it&#39;s to get you to the mall in a quick and stylish manner. I like the car, but I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be up for this battle we&#39;re going to do.  You&#39;re wrong. (Laughs) In 1911 noted Quaker and railroad tycoon built this... the first paved road in Washington state.</caption>
		<caption start="608">It was experimental by designand because of this it features a dizzying array of 25 corners and 8 hairpins across a buttery-smooth 3.6-mile serpentine path. But today, this historic landmark becomes a battleground. as these three aggressive sedans face off, in an ultimate battle of speed, handling and performance.</caption>
		<caption start="637">He&#39;s laying it on a bit thick don&#39;t you think? As I was saying, the rules for our battle are simpleWe&#39;re going to do our own take on a hillclimb challenge Race to the top, pass the tree, race back down again. Quickest time wins. But first, we should probably drive up this course.  None of us have been on it before and we don&#39;t want to go launching into the Columbia. So... can we take one of the cars besides our own? Can I take the Evo? Uh, sure, I guess... Yeah, the Evo, good sports handling... nice windy roads. Good idea Jess, I think I&#39;ll take the Evo.</caption>
		<caption start="666">The TL has a stick right? Mine! Okay. Acura TL.  I tested one of these not too long ago. I rather liked it, it&#39;s a nice car. Not sure about these roads though. If the roads are going to be a little too tight for this suspension? This is nice.</caption>
		<caption start="694">(music) Button here... Oh, okay, there we go. There&#39;s &quot;sport suspension&quot; and then there&#39;s Sport Suspension.  undefined Okay, wrrr. I feel like I&#39;m a robot.  Wrrrr. Wrrrr. Let&#39;s give this a try.</caption>
		<caption start="719">(music) undefined undefined undefined undefined undefined</caption>
		<caption start="744">undefined The Audi&#39;s interior is a command center when you&#39;re sitting behind the wheel. The Mitsubishi here, this is a cockpit, this is sporty, this is.. oh wow, that feels nice. I feel like the tires are gripping to the road better here, which is awesome. Acutally, a lot of fun.</caption>
		<caption start="769">undefined undefined undefined undefined I had so much fun in that thing! So what did you like best about the S4 versus the TL? Oh, my gosh, I felt like</caption>
		<caption start="794">I could really grip the road. I felt like me, and the car, and the road were all one. This you are one with the road, I mean every corner, you can feel where the wheels are gripping and slipping. The  S4 is a little spongier through the corners. I have to defend the TL. It seems spongy on the road, but when you acutally bring it  into these type of corners.</caption>
		<caption start="819">This car, the all-wheel drive systemif you acutally let it do its job and you really lay into the throttle into those corners... it turns into a different car. So, let&#39;s saddle-up, head to the bottom, and we&#39;ll get some times. undefined At the bottom of the Maryhill loops road, we  drew straws to determine who would get to go first. It was Aaron, in the 2011 Audi S4.</caption>
		<caption start="882">3-2-1, don&#39;t crash!Whoa! Your time was... your time was... 4-minutes and 55 seconds.  Good job, man. Good job! Alright, I&#39;m aiming for 6-minutes.</caption>
		<caption start="909">Six minutes is my goal. and 3-2-1 undefined ... go! Alright, here we go. Trying to make a good time. Ah! I wish I was driving the Audi.</caption>
		<caption start="935">(Bach on Guitar playing) undefinedundefined Alight, here we go I can see them, I can see... sweet victory! Sweet victory &#39;s a comin&#39;! (Laughing) Whoo! So Ryan and I have had dinner. I&#39;m not going lie...</caption>
		<caption start="964">I feel a little nautious. I don&#39;t know 5.. 5:45? Your time was 6-minutes... and 4 seconds.  Can&#39;t win them all. What time do you think I&#39;ll get? You did a 6:04 Can&#39;t win them all. What time do you think I&#39;ll get? You did a 4:55 and you did a 6:04...</caption>
		<caption start="989">Um, including crashing into the mountain?Okay, I&#39;m just going to go for it. Ready! 3-2-1 Go! Whoa! Clocks ticking...</caption>
		<caption start="1014">undefinedundefined How long does it take to do a 3-second countdown? 3-2- What just happened? Did you blame that on me? Yeah, I had launch control and I was waiting for the go... and that was the longest 3-2-1 I&#39;ve ever heard and my transmission overheated.</caption>
		<caption start="1039"> Can I get a countdown now?Alright, you ready? I don&#39;t know... we&#39;ll see if the transmission is. Yeah, backup cheater. I&#39;m one to talk. Back up! Okay.</caption>
		<caption start="1083">You ready? 321One of my favorite things about the Evo is the handbrake. It&#39;s actually designed to rotate the car and the shifts - lightening fast, very brutal, very brutal Alright.  undefined The biggest disadvantage are these tires, it just cannot grip.</caption>
		<caption start="1108">The tires are gone!Shot! Unfortunately I think I had a little too much fun in Shasta. &#39;Cause I need a fresh set of tires on this thing. Here we go, get set up for the one, two. Quit chiming at me! Brake system requires maintenance... great. Let&#39;s see.</caption>
		<caption start="1133">undefinedundefined undefined undefined (chuckles) That probably wasn&#39;t a very good time.</caption>
		<caption start="1158">Anyway, what do you think you got? Um, probably4:30. Exactly... point 5. Thank you. Wow! Sweet. That&#39;s a fast car that&#39;s made for a road  like this. This car, oh my oooh oooh! And, now it needs to be details. We&#39;ll just leave you alone with the car for a bit. No guys, come back we need to do...</caption>
		<caption start="1183">We&#39;ve now established that, three different drivers, three different cars... It doesn&#39;t mean very much. So, um, what should we do? Well, you had the fastest time, why don&#39;t you drive all three cars. So the S4, Supercharged 6. This is really funny, because we have - just think about these three cars.</caption>
		<caption start="1208">We have a supercharged V6, we have a naturally-aspirated V6 with VTEC in the TL. And we have a two-liter four cylinder with a twin-scroll turbo in the Mitsubishi Evolution.  How different can three cars, that are so similar,  be.  3-2-1, and we&#39;re off! Whoa! undefined Oh my God, the power... but let&#39;s talk about the bad things in this car.</caption>
		<caption start="1237">The steering feels mushy, almost like there&#39;s a slight delay when I&#39;m turning the wheels, or getting the grip and doing what they want... there&#39;s massive grip It&#39;s not instantanious, it doesn&#39;t have that punctuality that the Evo has. I mean it&#39;s a brilliant car - if you&#39;re going on long trips it&#39;s  the choice in that option. But in this situation? Going for time. On one of the greatest driving roads in the world.</caption>
		<caption start="1262">It&#39;s not as bad asthe old V8, and this transmission, it refuses to do exactly what I want when I want it.  What we got? 4:44 - eh, I could go faster.  Moving on, TL.</caption>
		<caption start="1287">3-2-1undefined Ow! undefined undefined PLEASE RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE (Laughing)</caption>
		<caption start="1312">undefined Oh my god! undefined What time was it? 4:20 Four minutes and twenty seconds... With the worst start... in history.</caption>
		<caption start="1337">You beat the Mitsubishi Evo by 10 seconds. To recap, Aaron pulled a 4:55 in the Audi S4 Me in the TL, a 6:04. Ryan in the Evo a 4:30. When Ryan took the wheel he improved the S4&#39;s time  with a 4:44, but shocked everyone in Acura with a 4:20. Fastest run of the day.</caption>
		<caption start="1362">And finally, we are at the end of this particular road. Though the Acura TL was the quickest, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s necessarely the best. In fact, the TL was our least favorite of the three cars. Nice enough, but the experience was underwhealming. The S4 was easy to love. But, when the chips were down. Traction control was imply too intrusive, even when it was &quot;disabled.&quot; A beautiful car, but no fun in the corners.</caption>
		<caption start="1390">Then there&#39;s the Mitsubishi Evolution MR Touring. It was basic. Raw. It was rude. But it was also comfortable and capable.  Even after taking one on the chin and wearing through a complete set of tires. It performed like a Rock Star. This made the Evolution a suprise favorite. As these three sedans have shown us. Specs alone don&#39;t tell the whole story.</caption>

<title>Fieldsports Britain - Deerstalking, more deerstalking and Olympic clays</title>
<captions>
	<caption start="28">[Music] Welcome to Fieldsports Britain Coming up: It&#39;s 2012 - Olympics year. Now - do you know the difference between your Skeet and your Sporting, and is Sporting even in the Olympics? Well, our Double Trap double-act Peter Wilson and Abbey Burton are here to tell them all apart. Who is the better shot out of you two? Me. [Abbey laughs] We&#39;ve got a new series for you: Team Wild TV.</caption>
	<caption start="53">They&#39;re hunting on an estate in Oxfordshire for fallow or muntjac or... they just want to hunt. First, continuing our series of ballistic field trials for Norma Ammunition, we&#39;re trying out the estate calibre of choice: the .270. Working through our ballistics we are now on to Norma&#39;s .270 round. We&#39;ve already seen the .</caption>
	<caption start="80">270 softpoint in action in Scotland in the summer when Norma&#39;s CEOwent stalking red stags. Torbjorn Lindskog spent five hours crawling through bogs, crossing streams and testing his stealth and patience to get into an optimum shooting position. His bullet dropped this stag where it stood. The field autopsy showed the damage the body shot had done. Moving forward a month or two and it&#39;s the end of the roebuck season.</caption>
	<caption start="110">We&#39;re on an estate in Oxfordshire, looked after by the English Safari Company&#39;s OliverPower. Our tools of the trade today are a Steyr Mannlicher .270, kindly loaned to us by the Sportsman Gun Centre of Exeter, with Zeiss Duralyt scope and a 110-grain Norma plastic-tipped bullet. Here is the grouping that Oliver achieved with this calibre at 100 metres.</caption>
	<caption start="137">For comparison between the soft point and plastic tip Oliver is hoping to make a headshot, this time on a young roebuck cull animal. It&#39;s a really nice day and instead of ruining a good walk by knocking a small ball about the fairways we are going to relish being in the great British countryside stomping around with a rifle. Oliver is a tall chap with a long gait and covers some serious ground.</caption>
	<caption start="167">We do have moments when we do slow, even stop, but it&#39;s when we are hitting last light thatwe strike lucky and witness a watercooler moment. A buck and doe are tucking in. Like moths round a flame, the deer are oblivious to our presence. Then the doe starts to get a little agitated. Not alarmed, just wary. Watching them is really thrilling - but we need that buck to get into a better position. The mood changes. She&#39;s off.</caption>
	<caption start="192">He thinks he should be off too but without commitment. Oliver takes his chance. He&#39;s in lovely condition - and Oliver talks us through the performance of this Norma .270 plastic-tipped bullet. So, it&#39;s the end of the buck season for us and we wanted to take off some cull animals.</caption>
	<caption start="219">And keeping our continuation of using softnosed ammunition and ballistic tip ammunition, wewent out and used a brand new round by Norma, in .270Win, which is 110 ballistic tip. And when we&#39;re usually culling these roebucks at the end of the season, we like to take head and neck shots where possible, to minimise any meat damage when we&#39;re sending these to the gamedealer, so we get a better price for our carcases.</caption>
	<caption start="244">So, towards last light, we came down here and found these two animals feeding at this bin. And we took a shot at around about 80 metres and headshot this buck. So let&#39;s have a look at the damage that this new round has created. So, here is the small diameter of the entry wound. Here.</caption>
	<caption start="269">And if we turn the animal gentlyover, move all these leaves, we can see the extensive exit wound. This has taken out the top of the spine, the neck, here. Taken out the major blood vessels and also destroyed the brain.</caption>
	<caption start="297">I mean, as repeated,these ballistics tips - when they do hit something, they do go off like a hand grenade and the fragmentation of the round has totally shredded everything it has come into contact with. The bullet has clearly done its job.</caption>
	<caption start="323">So, when stalkers are making bullet choices, who should be considering the 110-grain plastic-tipped Norma ammunition? The guy who should be buying this is the guy who really needs to cull a lot and wants animalsto drop on the spot. We&#39;ve walked a fair old way today and it&#39;s not over yet. To keep the pulses racing, the buck needs to be taken to the other side of the farm. Forget golf. Go deer stalking instead. You&#39;ll get much fitter and eat more healthily. Well, that was filmed on the last day of the roebuck season last year and, my goodness, the first day of the roebuck season this year is not far away.</caption>
	<caption start="349">Now, someone who&#39;s in season all year round. It&#39;s David on the Fieldsports Channel news stump. [Music] This is Fieldsports Britain news. Our own Roy Lupton has laid claim to a new British fox record. He called and shot the fox on New Year&#39;s Eve near East Grinstead in Sussex. It tipped the scales at 35.5lb and measured 130cm from nose to end of tail.</caption>
	<caption start="379">Obviously it&#39;s not every fox that we&#39;re shooting is making these sizes but we&#39;re definitely getting more and more individuals that are getting larger. This one is definitely a lot bigger than the one we saw last year. The full film can be found on our front page or look for &#39;Britain&#39;s biggest fox 2012&#39;. Prince Philip may have had a heart scare but he went straight from hospital to join his family on the post-Christmas Sandringham pheasant shoot.</caption>
	<caption start="404">He was driven from Papworth Hospital in Cambridge to join other royals at the lunch and then, according to reports, retired to Sandringham while the family resumed shooting. The rising price of venison is leading to poaching in Scotland. The meat has jumped in price from GBP1.60 per kilo to GBP2.20.</caption>
	<caption start="429">Alex Hogg, chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, says that poaching &quot;went fairlyquiet for a couple of years but it is creeping up again&quot;. And finally: poachers in the States are in a new kind of trouble. The authorities are looking at them on YouTube. A 44-year-old man legally licensed to hunt deer in Connecticut was taken into custody for failure to report a kill within 24 hours. Local environmental officials saw the film he made on his YouTube site, and he now faces a GBP150 fine and/or 60 days in jail.</caption>
	<caption start="455">You are now up to date with Fieldsports Britain News - stalking the stories, fishing for facts. [Music] Thank you David. So easily bought.</caption>
	<caption start="480">Now: Team Wild TV with Ian Harford[Music] This morning I&#39;m meeting with Keith Watson of Cervus UK in Oxfordshire. There&#39;s a promise of muntjac and fallow in woodland nearby. We know there&#39;s plenty of deer here as Owen Beardsmore, who manages this land, has placed a number of his Moultrie M80 mini cams around the place. So Keith, what&#39;s the score for this morning then? Well, basically, we&#39;re going to operate in a wildlife reserve down in the Chilterns.</caption>
	<caption start="505">There&#39;s by far too many deer in the area, as you will see by the condition of the woodland. It&#39;s just - we&#39;ve got a little bit of an imbalance, as such. So, we start the day from a highseat and we&#39;ll stalk along the one bank if we&#39;re not successful from the seat. So, there&#39;s three species of deer on the land here? In this area yes: there&#39;s roe, fallow and muntjac. There is a very limited amount of roe deer, so we don&#39;t shoot them. We tend to leave them at the moment and see what will happen with them. But they&#39;ve been suppressed by the other deer really.</caption>
	<caption start="531">So, we&#39;re looking for a young, immature fallow buck? Preferably, preferably - or a fallow doe. And we&#39;re going to be sitting in one of your own, personally-built highseats? Yes. I hear they are incredibly sturdy and I&#39;m going to feel very safe. Well, I think so. [Laughs] You&#39;ll have to tell me. OK - well - we&#39;re good to go. Okey-doke. We disembark and head up a very steep wooded slope towards our highseat. It&#39;s not long before a muntjac buck lets us know he&#39;s not happy we&#39;ve invaded his space.</caption>
	<caption start="559">Less than 40 yards away - literally just there. And he is not happy that we are here. Keith and I reach the highseat and then get comfortable. And still our muntjac has plenty to say for himself.</caption>
	<caption start="585">After he&#39;s almost barked himself hoarse, he appears about 40 yards in front of us, trailinga doe. A shot presents itself but I feel it&#39;s too good a buck to take. This one needs a couple more years to reach its potential. The opportunity comes and goes and we make the decision to regroup and see if we can spot something on foot. So, the nice buck we saw there, and he was with a doe. So, tell us a little bit about the buck. It&#39;s a nice buck. It&#39;s - I&#39;m not.</caption>
	<caption start="611">With the view that he gave us I&#39;m not 100 per centsure that it&#39;s a buck that we have seen previously on this site area. Obviously we have limitations on the bucks that people are allowed to cull. The doe - unfortunately - the doe - to me - because it was being pursued by a buck - well, not heavily - but it was being pursued - they were hanging in together - it is my belief that that doe had recently given birth. You could see that the belly is quite saggy. So on humane grounds, I wouldn&#39;t want anybody to shoot that doe because you&#39;d be orphaning the fawn.</caption>
	<caption start="637">OK - well they look like they&#39;ve settled down now for the day I&#39;d say they&#39;ve camped up somewhere. So, now what&#39;s the plan? Now what I&#39;m going to do: we&#39;ll just see if we can go up and see if we can catch another glimpse of this buck. If not, we&#39;ll head along the bottom of the valley. We&#39;ve got all the embankments. All the shots are safe. So if we come across anything - if we come across a fallow... Perfect. We start slowly, and eagle-eyed Keith spots a fallow up ahead.</caption>
	<caption start="664">It shows itself along the skyline but is nowhere to be seen when we get to the path at thetop of the ridge, it&#39;s nowhere to be seen. But I remain positive. The winter&#39;s been so mild there&#39;s still plenty of grass on the forest floor, so that the fallow could be anywhere. There&#39;s plenty of food here for them. But every now and again we come against a ride or a clearing with more dense vegetation so hopefully we&#39;ll happen across a group in one of those areas. It&#39;s not tough terrain, but it&#39;s noisy underfoot, and there are plenty of sentries on duty.</caption>
	<caption start="692">There are plenty of pheasants in this woodland. There&#39;s a cock bird just taken off. There&#39;s another one on a branch over there just ready to go, so we have to take it steady. The last thing we need to do is to flush 40 or 50 cock birds or make a noise at the moment. Nice and steady - take your time. Having reached the edge of our woodland, we call it a morning.</caption>
	<caption start="718">Our next challenge is to find Owen&#39;s mini camera to download the images and replacethe SD card. So we&#39;re going to go and have breakfast now - a recap on the day. I&#39;m going to give Keith a bit of ribbing for not letting me shoot that buck. And we&#39;ll come back and try this afternoon. So, before we head out this afternoon, I&#39;d just like to run through some of the kit that I&#39;ve brought with me today. Starting on my rifle. I&#39;ve brought my Sauer 202 in 7x64. This is the Outback model with the fluted barrel and the very smart Realtree stock.</caption>
	<caption start="745">You may be able to see that I am quite partial to my Realtree equipment. A couple of reasons: firstly, because I&#39;m the managing director of Realtree&#39;s international business and secondly because it&#39;s the world&#39;s most effective camouflage patterns. But anyway - that&#39;s enough of that. On my Sauer 7x64, I also have this Zeiss Victory Diavari FL 4-16x50 riflescope. This is my favourite piece of glassware.</caption>
	<caption start="772">It&#39;s been all over the world with me and it&#39;s a very consistent performer, both in low lightand for long distance. In addition to that, I have my Zeiss Victory 10x45 rangefinding binoculars which are probably the best all-round hunting binoculars in the world. They&#39;ve got a built-in rangefinder and the 10x45 means a perfect aperture for low light conditions as well. When it comes to stalking just for a day, I do tend to travel quite light.</caption>
	<caption start="798">I always bring a backpack with me with some basic equipment including gloves, my Buck110 folding hunting knife. And also my sandwiches, flask and a head torch. But other than that you really don&#39;t need too much. As we were talking earlier on today with Keith, one of the things that worries me most when you turn up for a day&#39;s stalking is people that bring a huge rucksack full of stuff that they are never going to use. Travel light. Only take what you need. So. And let&#39;s not forget my Realtree Rusky - Deerhunter Rusky outfit. This is in Realtree AP.</caption>
	<caption start="823">It is their heaviest weight hunting outfit. It has a zip-in liner which I haven&#39;t worn today. The weather isn&#39;t too cold here today. It&#39;s still quite mild. But, like I say, Realtree AP is a perfect camouflage pattern for this particular environment. It is winter here - there are no leaves on the trees. The shadowing and the detail in the pattern fit very comfortably with our hunting environment.</caption>
	<caption start="848">We&#39;ve got a bit of a walk to get to this particular high seat, but we have to take it slow, glassing the woodland all the way. So, as you can see the weather&#39;s changed this afternoon. This morning it was a little bit breezy. Now the air is completely still but it&#39;s raining. Not too heavily but it&#39;s a consistent rain. The ground&#39;s a little soggy underfoot and everything is completely still.</caption>
	<caption start="876">The problem being that every twig that snaps now is really loud. The highseat gives us a great view in three directions. It&#39;s a perfect spot and I can&#39;t see how this wouldn&#39;t provide us an opportunity. And within 30 minutes, a couple of muntjac make a dash for it across the ride. Luckily for us, the courting pair make their way around and down towards us. I can just see him. And at last an opportunity presents itself. I can just see him. He&#39;s down, and I&#39;m pleased with my shot. So, he&#39;s a little fellow. So, he&#39;s fallen just in front of the tree where I shot him.</caption>
	<caption start="906">So he&#39;s a nice, young buck. How old would you say he is, then, Keith? He&#39;s quite thick at the bottom there. Yeah. That&#39;s short off his head. He&#39;s probably older than you think.</caption>
	<caption start="932">It&#39;s handsome. As you can see, nice frothy blood - a double lung shot - and got him pretty much exactly where he stood. He didn&#39;t know what hit him, bless him. A very beautiful animal - a nice handsome animal. Let&#39;s roll him over and have a look at the exit wound here. As you can see, it&#39;s come right through to the other side.</caption>
	<caption start="957">So that&#39;s a Sauer 202 7x64 156-grain Norma Oryx, so it&#39;s a fantastic round. Obviously that&#39;s exited here. We&#39;ll never find the bullet but mushrooms perfectly. And this is a textbook shot on a muntjac. So, very happy with this. Didn&#39;t feel it coming. The doe disappeared into the bushes. So, great. Now off to the larder. It&#39;s my first time out with Cervus UK and it&#39;s been a great experience.</caption>
	<caption start="983">I look forward to returning soon. For more information visit www.cervus-uk.co.uk If you want to find out more about the Moultrie M80 mini cams, drop Owen a line at owen@cervus-uk.co.uk [Music] Skeet, Double Trap, Olympic Trap, Sporting.</caption>
	<caption start="1010">Which one&#39;s the odd one out? With the London 2012 Olympics coming up, here&#39;s the CPSA&#39;s guide to all the shooting disciplines. Confused by the clay shooting disciplines? Here&#39;s a guide from the national body in England, the CPSA, to what they&#39;re all about. The biggest discipline is Sporting. More people shoot Sporting in the UK than all the other clay disciplines put together. Here is one of the greats of Sporting, nineteen-times world champion George Digweed.</caption>
	<caption start="1038">With Sporting, you are only as good as your last result. You&#39;ve got to keep going out, keep your focus, keep driving on, shoot each target individually, as one target, and build your score each week with that method. If you go out with (1) delusions of grandeur or (2) a score in mind you will never achieve what you want.</caption>
	<caption start="1063">Then there is trapshooting, which includes Automatic Ball Trap, Universal Trench andmany others. London 2012 is hosting three different shotgun sports: Olympic Trap, Double Trap and Olympic Skeet. Our comperes to explain these disciplines are Peter Wilson, ranked number one in the world for Double Trap, and Abbey Burton, who won silver in Olympic Trap at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Shall we just establish: who is the better shot out of you two? Me.</caption>
	<caption start="1088">[Abbey laughs] She tries really hard - I have to say. Oh yeah, yeah. I think I have a height disadvantage. What - he&#39;s nearer the clays? Everyone says that. It&#39;s a nightmare. It&#39;s not very fair, is it? OK - tell me the difference between Trap and Double Trap. As a spectator you&#39;d think we are shooting exactly the same discipline. Everyone stands in exactly the same way. It&#39;s just how you address the targets, in the sense that we are only using three traps out of the bunker and otherwise for Olympic Trap they are using all fifteen.</caption>
	<caption start="1119">So - yeah - some people call it harder. [Abbey laughs] I don&#39;t know. I mean... Fifteen traps to three? I mean - come on. [Abbey laughs] Oh my g... OK, if this is going to go there, this is going to get exciting. No, so you&#39;ve got fifteen traps for Olympic Trap, of which you have three under each peg, so you&#39;ll see - looking at it from a perspective, an outsider&#39;s perspective - you&#39;re going to see on each peg someone standing, five in a row... we shoot a little bit slower but we shoot two in the air at once. Right. I would say that was massively confusing. Abbey, here&#39;s a competitive sport.</caption>
	<caption start="1148">Can you explain that in a more simple way?&#39;Course I can, &#39;course I can. Basically, Olympic Trap, we shoot - when we call for a target they can go anywhere within forty-five degrees high or low. With Double Trap it&#39;s a fixed position, two clays instead of obviously our one. Very difficult. Very, very difficult But with ours we don&#39;t know where it&#39;s going at the time of calling. Two shots at it though. Yeah. Two shots. I agree. I agree, but you know where they&#39;re coming from every single time. OK - they&#39;ve got the delay to contend with as well.</caption>
	<caption start="1175">Olympic Trap doesn&#39;t have a delay, so the minute you call, the clay is released, and that can go anywhere within forty-five degrees. With Pete&#39;s discipline, Double Trap, they call and it is up to a three-second delay before the clay is actually released. A second delay. Second. One-second delay. Is it one second? I thought it was three. No, one. It&#39;s only one now? So it&#39;s even easier? One, everyone. One. It&#39;s even easier. It&#39;s easier than she thinks.</caption>
	<caption start="1201">Oh my God. [Abbey laughs] She&#39;s getting old guys. Don&#39;t worry about it. Since you seem to know so much about it, can we talk about Olympic Skeet? Abbey - there are towers here as well as trenches. What do they do? Well, Olympic Skeet is what - the two towers are part of that particular discipline. You have one high tower and one low tower and they both cross a point in the middle.</caption>
	<caption start="1226">You shoot it from a horseshoe shape of stands, including the one that&#39;s in the middle peg, which Pete would be good at, because he&#39;s closer in the middle - taller. So he should have picked Skeet not Double Trap, really. We are at one of the top clay grounds in the UK, Southern Counties in Dorset, which became the first British clayground for thirty years to host a Shotgun World Cup in 2010. Stevan Walton is another top Double Trap shooter.</caption>
	<caption start="1252">I started at eight years old at my godfather&#39;s farm, shooting a few balloons really, floating across a field. Shooting balloons floating across a field? What a good idea. Obviously with a .410, with the recoil, because I was a young lad. Yeah - my mother blew them up, set them off across the field with the wind and away it went from there really. Tell me about Double Trap itself.</caption>
	<caption start="1277">What does it consist of?It consists of a normal Trap layout - five stands, five pegs. So you shoot a pair and move on to the next peg. It&#39;s a fixed target: two pairs going away, quartering away, going 55 yards, and it&#39;s 50 shots a round, three rounds, so 150, and the top six go into a &#39;flash final&#39;, and it&#39;s over 200 targets. So, compared to the other Olympic disciplines, is it, I mean is it... what special skills do you need? Special skills: you need to like to shoot a lot of targets unfortunately.</caption>
	<caption start="1304">It&#39;s very robotic. You have to shoot exactly the same every peg. You have to get a lot of lead down the barrel. The CPSA promotes shooting at all levels. For more about clayshooting disciplines go to www.cpsa.co.</caption>

<title>Fieldsports Britain - Tropical trout and a gold medal goat</title>
<captions>
	<caption start="30">[Music] Welcome to Fieldsports Britain, coming to you this week from Kenya. Coming up: I go fishing on a river where the evening rise is spectacular. Think you are pretty accurate with a gun? A Maasai warrior teaches me how to knock down an antelope with a stick at it. First: I want to find out more about one of my favourite Kenyan sporting quarries, the trout.</caption>
	<caption start="59">In 1905, the maverick Africa pioneer, Colonel Ewart Grogan, who had recently walked fromthe Cape to Cairo, ordered 40,000 baby trout from Loch Leven in Scotland, which he delivered to the rivers and lakes around Mount Kenya. Quite an undertaking. Since then, others have introduced other trout to the area. I want to see what these fish are up to today, so let&#39;s start like Colonel Grogan started more than a century ago. I am in the town of Naru Moro, just at the foot of Mount Kenya at a trout farm.</caption>
	<caption start="86">Is it easy to keep trout here in Kenya? Yeah, it is easy, but you see this fish is a lot of money and most Kenyans cannot rear it because is needs a lot of money to keep, money in terms of feed, in terms of workforce, it demands a lot of work.</caption>
	<caption start="112">Is this the only trout farm? I think this is the biggest trout farm in Kenya and the second is a government-ownedfarm. And are these special Mount Kenyan trout? Yes, this is Mount Kenyan trout, rainbow trout, I&#39;m told it is the sweetest fish around. This trout farm also has a popular restaurant and takeaway, located in a tree. It&#39;s on the Trans African Highway and worth a stop if you happen to be following Colonel Grogan&#39;s footsteps. In a hot country where the electricity supply is unreliable and meat goes off quickly, the best way to keep your lunch fresh is to keep it alive.</caption>
	<caption start="141">The biggest problem facing wild trout in a country where the population growth is terrifying is pollution, extraction and poaching. This is the Naro Moru river. I am less than 10 miles from its source on Mount Kenya. It is too polluted here to sustain life and within a few miles it dries up altogether. But I am not here to moan. I am here to fish.</caption>
	<caption start="167">Quite the most stylish way to find what areleft of Colonel Grogan&#39;s trout is by chopper. If you want to go helifishing on Mount Kenya, contact Tropicair www.tropicairkenya.com I&#39;m actually going to go fishing later in the programme. First, it&#39;s David on the Fieldsports Channel news stump.</caption>
	<caption start="194">[Music]This is Fieldsports Britain News The US Fish and Wildlife Service say that crushed rhino horn powder is now more expensive than the American price of cocaine. It fetches more than £30,000 per kilogram in Asia, a price that threatens to wipe out the world&#39;s estimated 28,000 remaining animals. These animals were filmed in Lake Nakuru National Park two weeks ago.</caption>
	<caption start="221">Since then, two have beenpoached. The South African environment ministry may introduce &#39;end-user&#39; certificates for rhino hunters. It says applications for hunting permits will only be accepted from bona fide hunters from countries that ensure horns are being used as hunting trophies, not traditional medicines. It is expected to turn down hunting applications from Vietnam.</caption>
	<caption start="250">Back in Kenya, a lioness was killed and dismembered in the Maasai Mara area at the beginning ofApril. Around 10 young Maasai warriors speared the animal to death and cut off its tail and front legs as part of a tribal ceremony. Rangers found the trophies, arrested one suspect while the whereabouts of the others is still not known. Some 16 lions have been lost in the area since November last year, around 1 per cent of the total Kenyan population. No arrests have been made.</caption>
	<caption start="279">The Kenya Wildlife Service has released figures about its war on the trade in ivory and bushmeat,including zebra meat. In the last week of March alone, KWS officers shot dead six poachers, including three in Tsavo East National Park. They made more than 30 further arrests and recovered five guns including AK47s, a G3 rifle and more than 300 rounds of ammunition and poisoned arrows. A KWS spokesman says: &quot;The fight against wildlife crime continues.</caption>
	<caption start="306">&quot;And finally, a hyena attack that injured three people who were asleep in a donkey cart in Tanzania has been blamed by locals on witchcraft. One resident said cases of people being sent hyenas to attack them were prevalent. You are now up to date with Fieldsports Britain News. Stalking the stories, fishing for facts.</caption>
	<caption start="331">[Music]Thank you David - more English beech tree than African baobab. Now, Kenya may have an embarrassing bushmeat poaching problem but there is one group of people who are allowed to hunt. Being a lion to Leitato&#39;s warrior is strangely terrifying and also superb.</caption>
	<caption start="359">If that&#39;s howhe hunts lion I wish I could too, but lion hunting by anyone except Maasai is illegal in Kenya. Instead, he&#39;s going to give me a lesson in clubbing antelope to death. First stop is the drug store, in this case a thorn bush called Acacia nilotica. We prepare ourselves to face the lions that we take some natural drugs and herbs.</caption>
	<caption start="388">This is to try to check the warriors and to give motivation to the warriors for then wheneverwe see the lions because, as I think you know, the lions are big animals, so the warriors also must have to prepare themselves for that. Let&#39;s say we spot the lions in a specific bush, then we start singing the courageous and motivation song, so the drugs that we have been using, the natural drugs we have been using from the bush, now come in to effect. Also when you kill the lion you can also win many girlfriends.</caption>
	<caption start="418">You can also become an importantMaasai warrior after you kill a lion. Also, you can become the king of that group after you have succeeded to kill a lion because, when we are in that competition, we don&#39;t point that so-and-so you tried to spear a lion. No it&#39;s a competition where you all go and try all your level best, all your level best to spear the lion first.</caption>
	<caption start="448">More than theother warriors. Then that time you are declared the winner, and on that day we make a lot of celebration, dancing with our girlfriends, with our fathers for that day will be a big day for you. I have to ask have you got a lot of girlfriends? Yeah, me? Now I have five girlfriends. Perfect. Did you kill the lion? Yeah, I killed the lion.</caption>
	<caption start="473">OK, so you are really on your way up. You can see also from the mane. In our tradition you are not allowed to wear anything from the lion if you are not the killer of the lion. I feel a bit like the 1960s British politician who goes on television to take LSD: &quot;It&#39;s not doing much more for me than a glass of good claret&quot;. Next, I have a lesson in how to use the throwing stick. First you balance the stick in your hand.</caption>
	<caption start="503">Leitato shows me foot position that is justlike using a shotgun. And like a double-barrelled 12-bore, Leitato recommends carrying two sticks. He shows just how lethal sticks can be when he aims at his Maasai robe or &#39;shukar&#39;. My attempt wouldn&#39;t knock down a small rat - but I&#39;m learning. Now the exciting bit - the hunting, though for Leitato this is no more than pest control.</caption>
	<caption start="529">Eating game meat is taboo for the Maasai. He feeds it to his dogs. Normally Leitato uses his stick with deadly effect on game and small animals that come to close while he is cattle herding. This morning we are going to see what we can walk up. Lurking in the thorn bushes is a dikdik, one of Kenyan&#39;s smallest antelope. A group of children have seen it. Leitato at once enlists them as beaters.</caption>
	<caption start="557">They start at oneend of the scrub and thorn while we wait at the other. Leitato is not convinced that the animal is still there, so we soon call them off. The next animals to cross our path is a large family of mongoose. Leitato is quick on his toes. We are not short of game here, but it all seems to have learnt the effective range of a stick. First we sneak up on more dikdik.</caption>
	<caption start="585">Another couple of hundred yards and thereis an impala. The animal crossings over the muddy stream beds show the numbers of game here. And the drugs are still working. Leitato&#39;s shot at a giraffe is ambitious. At the end of the walk round, it has been fun but Leitato&#39;s dogs will go hungry. I have to ask him whether he reckons people like me will be able to go hunting in Kenya.</caption>
	<caption start="610">What do you think about tourists coming here to hunt? Do you think that would work or not work in Kenya? No, I think that one will not work here in Kenya. It works everywhere else. Yes, but here in Kenya no, not allowed. It&#39;s not allowed, but could it work? You get 12,000 dollars for a buffalo and you have got herds of 400 buffalo out there. No, we don&#39;t want that.</caption>
	<caption start="643">Me I can say yes, that one is not good, because it will notwork. It&#39;s been fascinating and I am glad I have learnt a new skill to add to my armoury. Look out the rabbits back at home. For Leitato, it is all about cattle and the defence of cattle, before you ask him to defend your herd the Maasai belief set is that their god says they own all the cattle in the world. Can be a drawback. Now, I&#39;m off to the bush to go fishing.</caption>
	<caption start="672">We are after mud fish, which is appropriate, because recent rains have coloured the TelekRiver here in the Maasai Mara. My guide Reuben is not confident about our chances. Reuben is using the time-honoured method of stick, string and hook with meat on. Fishing here has its dangers. More people die in Africa from attacks by these guys than any other mammal bar humans. Here&#39;s half the reason it&#39;s not easy to catch fish here.</caption>
	<caption start="701">The other half is the recent rains,making the river too muddy to catch mudfish. The mud also makes it hard to drive from river to river. So here is a short guide to getting yourself out of a hole, Maasai style.</caption>
	<caption start="730">[Music]All too soon it&#39;s time to pack up, leave the torrid plains of the Maasai Mara, and fly back up north to the long, cool, English summer afternoon that is Mount Kenya and the Aberdares. For Colonel Grogan&#39;s trout, you pays your money and you takes your choice.</caption>
	<caption start="756">Either it&#39;sa long walk or a helicopter up Mount Kenya where you can be in with the chance of a 20lber. Or you do what I do, pay 50 US dollars for a park ticket plus 5 dollars for a fishing permit and drive into the Aberdares national park. The signs are good as I get to the Chania river. There&#39;s another bloke fishing. He has an audience too. And there&#39;s that most discerning of anglers, a fish eagle.</caption>
	<caption start="782">So we are here, 10,000 feet above sea level, sweltering, actually apparently burnt out landscape. This more than reminds me of the book Salmon Fishing in the Yemen where they try and release salmon in to a Yemeni Wadi, but this is the centre of the great dream to bring trout to Kenya and I am going to try and catch one. There are more reasons this is a special park. Many of Kenya&#39;s parks are open grassland.</caption>
	<caption start="811">This one is high hills, forest and moorland. It is the first of Kenya&#39;s national parks to be fenced all the way round, protecting it from development, especially the rivers which, like it or not, provide Nairobi with water. And the British know the Aberdares best because 50 years ago this year, our Princess Elizabeth was here at the Treetops lodge when she heard the news that her father, the King, had died at Sandringham.</caption>
	<caption start="838">The fishing is surprisingly similar to fishing a Scottish moorland stream - but the highland cattle are more deadly. According to one fishing friend, the only fly you need is a size 8 marabou coachman, fished wet - that&#39;s an ordinary coachman but tied with a white fluffy marabou stork feather as its wing, to give it an East African twist. It&#39;s not as unusual as you might think. More than half the fishing flies sold in the world are made in Kenya.</caption>
	<caption start="864">Visitwww.fishingfliesandlures.com The fish are here, and they are beautiful to watch, but the water is crystal clear so I might as well be a herd of hippopotamus. We fish for a few miles up the Chania River - and then my local help hears something that makes him nervous. So we fish back down again, just to show we aren&#39;t afraid of old laughing-boy hyena.</caption>
	<caption start="890">It is not just the hyenas that are closing in. The weather is too. I don&#39;t recommend you do what I did which was travel thousands of miles from the UK for a day&#39;s trout fishing in the Aberdares where you don&#39;t catch anything. But I did get to feel one of Colonel Grogan&#39;s Loch Leven trout on the end of my line and that is worth the visit.</caption>
	<caption start="919">Now it&#39;s time to slip away from Kenya and head for Wales where Team Wild TV is huntinggoats in the mountains. [Roar of stag] We&#39;re in Snowdonia, north Wales. It&#39;s phase two of my goal to get some of the UK&#39;s biggest trophy specimens. We&#39;ve come to this stunning part of the country for goats, big goats.</caption>
	<caption start="948">Guiding me today is Owen Beardsmore of Cervus UK who is pretty grateful we weren&#39;t hereearlier in the week. Did you hear what the farmer was saying? Last week they had all the snow up here and we have had three days of horrendous rain and this is the first decent day. You&#39;re a decent outfitter so I knew you would get it organised. Not often I can prescribe good weather, but let&#39;s hope we&#39;ve got some today.</caption>
	<caption start="974">We head up the valley from where we are going to have to walk, probably vertically and possiblyfor quite a while. We scan the Welsh mountains and Owen tells me a little bit more about these hardy feral animals. It&#39;s a feral goat and has been at liberty for over 100 years.</caption>
	<caption start="1005">There&#39;s quite a few stories about how they got here: they escaped from a farm, they were let go from a farm originally, and the area we&#39;re in there&#39;s about 250 of which we&#39;re looking for a good quality representativeold billy which hopefully sometime during today we will be able to find. As long as the weather doesn&#39;t come in we should be OK. They seem to be mixing. There are a lot of sheep here as well. They seem to co-habit quite peacefully then? Yes, they keep themselves to themselves. The sheep don&#39;t cause any damage. They are meant to be here. They belong to the farms.</caption>
	<caption start="1032">The goats stay on the tops in the summer and thencome down in the winter and that&#39;s when they cause all the damage. The numbers are controlled to protect grazing and to reduce the amount of damage to the dividing dry stone walls. All you need is a herd of goats jumping the wall in the same spot and suddenly the whole lot comes down. For this special quarry species I&#39;ve brought something a little bit special.</caption>
	<caption start="1060">OK we&#39;re up in the welsh hills, what toy have you brought to play with this time?OK. Don&#39;t be scared, OK? This is a Haenel RS8 sniper rifle. Now you did tell me we could be shooting over reasonably long distances so I said to my friends at Viking Arms who normally send me Ruger rifles and Merkel rifles that I might need something with a little bit extra legs, so they said they had just the thing for me.</caption>
	<caption start="1088">So what do you think tothat? It is 5.8kg unscoped and then Zeiss very kindly sent me the largest scope in the history of the world which is this. That is a large one. Zeiss Victory Diavari FL 6-24x72 which also looks as though it weighs about 5kg on its own. I&#39;ve got a cunning plan.</caption>
	<caption start="1115">We&#39;ll spot the goats at about 100 metres, drop back to about 400and you can shoot it, OK? OK. Well hopefully we are going to get as close as we can, as we do like to make sure of our kills. It&#39;s not what you would call a traditional mountain rifle. No? Well you are not the traditional kind of guy. No, I think you are probably right. So let&#39;s see what we can do with it. OK, let&#39;s go. Owen finds a group of billies which he tells me we need to get above, which of course means climbing. Am I regretting bringing such a big boy&#39;s rifle? Not at all.</caption>
	<caption start="1145">You can&#39;t beata bit of fresh mountain air and some strenuous exercise. You know, I should be used to this by now. Every time I climb a mountain I get half way up and think &#39;you need to lose some weight&#39;, and here we are again, onwards and upwards.</caption>
	<caption start="1170">When we do stop for a quick breather, Owen shows us what the goats have been grazingon. This is what they&#39;ve been feeding on, these little berries. They go black in the end. They&#39;re really nice when they are ripe. They have nipped off nearly all the tops of these bushes. I take it they feed on the berries and they start on the grass later. Absolutely. Just always picking the best feed source.</caption>
	<caption start="1196">Anyway let&#39;s get ourselves up therethat was a good quick break we had. Owen has a spot and reports back. There are two goats making their way up the valley and one below us. It sounds like one is a medal. He&#39;s just over that ridge. If we go up to this top the wind&#39;s great for us because we are above him and we have got a nice safe shot down. You should be able to take him. He&#39;s lying down so you may have to wait a minute until he stands up.</caption>
	<caption start="1221">We&#39;ve got plentyof time. OK, let&#39;s go. It looks like a gold medal, is that all right? Is that all right? of course that&#39;s all right. My goat is lying up in the heather and all we can see are some horns rising up like Harley Davidson handlebars. He can&#39;t be more than 50 yards away, but there is just a ridge. We&#39;ve got to wait for him to stand up, but he is a big goat.</caption>
	<caption start="1250">We wait and wait. This goat is in no hurry to show himself. When he does stand he is face on and I am not happy with the shot. I can tell the heather is going to be a real hindrance today and I am going to have to be patient. As he moves, another one, two, three goats rise from the heather. A couple have broken horns and would make good cull animals, but all in good time.</caption>
	<caption start="1278">Let&#39;s cross over that particular bridge once I&#39;ve gotmy medal. All in a row, the older male at the front finally shows me a clean shot. He is down and the others haven&#39;t gone far, staying with the dominant male. Owen and I discuss the other animals. I&#39;m going to take out the two with broken horns. The heather means an engine room shot is not safe and at this distance I&#39;m confident in taking a spine shot.</caption>
	<caption start="1313">Bothgoats drop where they stand. Oh what a cracker. Well done mate. Congratulations. It&#39;s absolutely huge. What a beautiful animal. Got a really good cape on him as well. Actually it is not as thick as it looks.</caption>
	<caption start="1341">By the time you go through it you&#39;re right downto the skin already. You can see here the exit wound. Actually that is the entry wound. It&#39;s very difficult to make out on these exactly where to shoot them. So if you imagine there is its shoulder, that&#39;s the bottom of its chest and that&#39;s the top of its back, so although it looks half way up its body, it&#39;s just in the right spot.</caption>
	<caption start="1369">Want to see how old he is. Obviously with a goat he doesn&#39;t cast, so you get the growth, one year, two, three, four... Hold on, one year, two, three, four, five, six...</caption>
	<caption start="1395">Six, I would say. What a beautiful animal. Now you told me they were a bit smelly, but actually having followed you up the mountain all day this smells quite pleasant. Now the second one, this is quite a bigger one. Obviously he&#39;s got one broken off.</caption>
	<caption start="1420">Why is it important to take these ones out? The problem you get is when they start rutting they are fighting each other, they don&#39;t connect uniformly which can cause a lot of damage to the other billies. So it&#39;s like an unfair advantage. It doesn&#39;t necessarily kill them, but what they end up getting is like fly strike. It&#39;s like sheep. They die a really horrible slow death. So it&#39;s a good one to take out. Any of the broken ones we try to take out.</caption>
	<caption start="1446">How old: one year, two, three, four years old. Still smells as old as his dad though. Now this one smells nasty, nastier than the other one.</caption>
	<caption start="1473">Now this one obviously didn&#39;t present me with a heart and lung shot so as you can see here I took him in the spine and he wentstraight down. But the bilberry was up to there Ian so you did well there. It was a lethal shot and he dropped on the spot, so well done. Right so let&#39;s get him back up then. See if we can find the next one. Same story with this one, look. So it must take some force to break these off.</caption>
	<caption start="1498">Really thick at the base, not as long as maybe you would have thought given those bases, what, four or five years old? Yes, one year, two, three, four, five. A year older than the other one. Exactly the same again. Couldn&#39;t get his heart and lungs, so went high in the shoulder took him through the shoulder and through the neck this time. What grain bullet were you using Ian? 185 grain. You told me they don&#39;t like to go down so with a .308.</caption>
	<caption start="1530">Normally I would onlyshoot up to 150 maybe up to 165-grain bullet, but seeing that I knew with your skills we would be getting close 185-grain Lapua Megas have certainly done the job today. Certainly have, well done, good shooting. Let&#39;s get them down. Before the steep descent just time for a quick picture with all three billy goats gruff.</caption>
	<caption start="1556">So we have had a fantastic day, we&#39;ve done a lot of climbing, we got the trophy we werelooking for and we have taken two with broken horns. Now the hard work begins. We have got to get all of this down there. [Roar of stag] This has been Fieldsports Britain. Motivational, courageous and unremittingly British.</caption>

<title>Fieldsports Britain - Seven wild boar in a row</title>
<captions>
	<caption start="29">[music] Welcome to Fieldsports Britain coming to you this week from the IWA gun trade show in Nuremberg. Coming up: A boar bonanza, the blade trade, a rifle so expensive it&#39;s being guarded by gladiators, Chinese water deer, rifle scopes, foxes and so much more.</caption>
	<caption start="65">[music] First, Europe&#39;s addiction with wild boar. This footage was playing on big screens and it was the talk of the show. A German princeling, practically a professional boar hunter, stopped seven animals in their tracks.</caption>
	<caption start="93">It may notsit well with some people, but his marksmanship cannot be questioned. The film has gone viral on YouTube and sales of Aimpoint scopes and Sauer rifles have soared as a result. The drive takes place in Hungary where the producers can guarantee the volume of boar.</caption>
	<caption start="120">How long did it take you to film this? This was filmed in different locations but in general I would say seven-to-eight daysin total. And what sort of size wild boar days were they? It looks like you were shooting a lot of animals. Yes, we were shooting quite a big bag there, but it is quite normal in Hungary because you have huge areas with a large population of only wild boar and other areas for red deer and other areas for fallow deer and so on. So we were focusing on the wild boar here in this movie.</caption>
	<caption start="147">So what would be a typical day if you were a gun in Hungary? How many might you see howmany might you shoot? Per person or by the group? Per person.</caption>
	<caption start="176">Per person, if you were lucky you would minimum shoot one, then you have a good day, but then you could shoot up to 10 wild boar in a day, depends on how skilled you are and how well trained you are, because they will come in a group you can manage to shoot maybe two or three out of a group if you are very skilled and then there are the exceptional shooters like Franz Albrecht who is in the movie who can shoot up to 10 in a group, that is topend. Normal hunters should be able to shoot one-to-three in an average day. What was your best day while you were filming? I shot during that day 17 wild boar on four different beats so that was a good day. Every European gun manufacturer worth its salt makes rifles for boar, but they also makes shotguns for pheasants.</caption>
	<caption start="201">I asked the question: pheasant or boar?Now you make both rifles and shotguns, you like both sports, but if you had to choose one, bird shooting or wild boar, which would it be? Don&#39;t ask me that. [laughter] I would go for the wild boar shooting. There is a gun for every occasion at IWA, this one has got an 8x57 barrel on one side and a 20-bore on the other so you don&#39;t have to go home between your grouse and your red stag. It costs GBP30,000.</caption>
	<caption start="228">There&#39;s a rather more expensive gun on this stand that requiresa gladiator to guard it. So, OK, this is a fairly expensive rifle. Am I right? Yes, that&#39;s right, that&#39;s the most expensive rifle that Sauer has made so far. Have you sold it? Yes we did. How much? GBP200,000 Wow [laughs] Who bought it? Are you allowed to say? It went to Italy of course, because this rifle shows a Roman scene and it&#39;s called the Gladiator.</caption>
	<caption start="259">That explains this guy over here. Of course, and he has to look after the rifle. Can you just talk me through some of the features, some of the bits on it? OK. This scene shows some fight of gladiators. Just there. Yes, it&#39;s all engraved and as you can see here the aquaduct is the open side of the rifle. All along there. And as you can see here it ends up at the front of the site.</caption>
	<caption start="289">That is the open side ofit and if you want to use the scope you just take that lid off... Oh my goodness. And this shows where the mount will come in. Now I want to have a look at a bit on the grip here, not something we are used to in the UK.</caption>
	<caption start="316">OK, this is a helmet of a gladiator and of course there are some special features inhere as well. As you can see there is another guy looking at you. Hidden inside, an original Roman. Yes, that&#39;s the face of that gladiator. We have a programme in the UK called the Antiques Roadshow so this is a bit like that. It&#39;s already an antique although it is a brand new rifle. Would you use this in Africa or would you use it in Europe before? Well it&#39;s a calibre .375 Holland and Holland.</caption>
	<caption start="342">You could use it for hunting purposes in Africaas well as in Germany or any other place in Europe for wild boar hunting. So these are the new range of hunting rifles from Anschuetz, the target specialists. Now, if you have wild boar and you want to keep them close we found something which is a cross between Fatal Attraction and Just Juice.</caption>
	<caption start="369">Well what we have done in the States is, we have pigs as well, we have created in the States attractants, apple attractant, corn attractant, they love corn, we feed them corn,also grape which is our Swine Wine, the grape, and it actually smells really pungent of grape as the Apple Smash smells like a bushel of apples times 10. And what it does is it attracts the pigs. A pig&#39;s nose is very sensitive and they smell very much.</caption>
	<caption start="396">So whenever they are foraging they smell the apple or the corn or the swine wine, the grape and they willcome to it. How are you judging the success of the attractant? In Florida, for example, a lot of game farms there have corn feeders for their deer, their turkey and of course the pigs are there. They have problems with the 400lb pigs coming in and knocking the corn feeders down so they really like the grape down there believe it or not.</caption>
	<caption start="421">So they dig a hole outside the corn feeder and put the grape on it and the bigpigs will start smelling that and beat all the little ones off so they&#39;ll start killing all the big ones which are knocking the corn feeders over. We have got story after story like that. So judging it is the fact that just using it and seeing that it works. Whenever you pour this stuff on the ground in the dirt you come back a month later and there is a hole in the dirt that big and there are pigs everywhere that means it works. [laughs] From gladiators getting stuffed in the Coliseum to another stuffed shirt.</caption>
	<caption start="448">It&#39;s David on theFieldsports Channel News Stump. [music] This is Fieldsports Britain News. The Scottish Gamekeepers Association has launched a fight back against politicians in the Scottish Government who they claim they want to wipe out the country&#39;s deer. Some Scottish politicians believe that a massive deer cull will lead to a collapse in the value of estates.</caption>
	<caption start="474">TheSGA warns that ill-conceived conservation projects will cause permanent devastation. In related news, Scottish Natural Heritage has launched a survey to find out what people about the work they have done so far.

	<caption start="500">uk/SNHwildlifeA charity shooting event celebrating the life of Jack Jeyes Blackburn has raised GBP3,500. The long-range shooting day was hosted by Chris and Pippa Blackburn from UK Gunworks at a grouse moor in the north of England. It was all in aid of the North Hampton General Hospital charitable fund. Jack was just days short of his first birthday when he fell ill.</caption>
	<caption start="525">The prize giving included some top-end Zeiss optics, meals, kit and were supported by friends, family and customers, many of whom knew Jack. If you would like to make a donation please email donate@jackjeyesblackburn.co.uk for more information. There&#39;s another big fox. This time it&#39;s from Wales.</caption>

A Somerset dairy farmer who spoke out in support of the badger cull has condemned animal rights campaigners whom he accuses of poisoning his milk and burning down his barns.</caption>
	<caption start="579">Stuart Thomas&#39;s herd tested positive to bovine TB for the first time in February prompting him to speakout to his local newspaper in support of the pilot badger culls. Within days, he believes animal activists started targeting his farm. While police say there does not appear to be a link at this stage they call the offences extremely serious.

	<caption start="636">We&#39;re on the Zeiss sport optics stand, a massive double decker,and we are talking to the top man about making it visible. Ralph, we are at IWA and this is the first chance the world has had to look in Europe at your new range. Can you tell me what we have got here? Now, here it is our brand new Victory HT. This is the brightest rifle scope we have ever built and you know Zeiss is already bright.</caption>
	<caption start="665">This comes up to 95 per cent light transmissionand not only bright it also has the finest illuminated dot in the world which is super bright. So this is an outstanding rifle scope, this comes together with our brand new Victory HT, this is the brightest binocular in the world. So you had the chance to try out the package.</caption>
	<caption start="690">I had the chance, I was stalking in the UK on Chinese water deer and muntjac and it wasa great opportunity. It has already been a successful morning. Ralph Nebe and Stefan Buehring from Zeiss Sports Optics have both bagged a muntjac buck in Bedfordshire. This little deer is a particular favourite with German hunters, but this visit filmed in November is extra special.</caption>
	<caption start="717">A new range of Zeiss optics are getting their first ever outing before the official launch atthe gun trade show IWA. Ralph has the first scope and binoculars off the production line from the Zeiss HT Victory range. He is confident that this high transmission glass technology will keep the competition in the dark. Brand new, just came out of production, it is really the first sample you see here.</caption>
	<caption start="745">It cost a hell of a lot of money, but we wanted to have it here to test it, also to get afeeling how it&#39;s handling. This is our new successor of the FL binocular. It&#39;s the Victory HT - HT similar idea. High transmission glass inside from Schott. That is the brightest binocular on the market. Nobody will be brighter, point, statement. You see it if you look through. We might be able to reach over, but at least up to 95 per cent light transmission.</caption>
	<caption start="770">We have already shown Stefan using the new Conquest HD binoculars. They were launched at the 2012 Shot Show in Las Vegas. It&#39;s not often that a manufacturer offers such a lot of new products in such a short time. It means exciting times for Zeiss&#39;s UK distributor Mark Karn. That&#39;s what you wait for because people love new products.</caption>
	<caption start="797">Yes I work for Zeiss but thisnew HT Victory HT line just surpasses everything for brightness and we&#39;ve also got a mid price binocular, so we have got three new products. I haven&#39;t known three new products at the same time in the same year for many a year, so it&#39;s all go now, I am really looking forward to it.</caption>
	<caption start="823">After everyone has had a chance to play with a shiny new optics on the range near Zeisspro stalker Paul Childerley&#39;s stalking ground, we head off with Ralph and Paul to see whether we can get a Chinese buck before dark. We stalk through a number of areas, working through woodland and open fields. On several occasions Paul tells Ralph to get ready on the sticks. This Chinese water deer is in thick cover and successfully avoids the cross hairs.</caption>
	<caption start="850">In the denser woodlands we make outshadows, but we want to hold off for a good buck. Paul brings out the Buttolo call to see what it will deliver. It worked like a dream this morning. An inquisitive doe shows herself and stands her ground just 20 yards from us. It really is a wonderful moment when you can stop, keep still and stare. This is all very well, but where is our Chinese water deer buck.</caption>
	<caption start="879">Paul suggests settling ina high seat for half an hour, this delivers nothing so with light fading fast it&#39;s back to the open fields which is where Ralph spots a buck. The camera has no chance, but Ralph takes an excellent shot. Paul is happy with the result. Well done Ralph. This is a gold medal Chinese similar to the one you shot before.</caption>
	<caption start="907">Good shottaken just on the edge of darkness which is ideal really just to catch him just before he went out of reach. Good shot, well done. Thanks for guiding me. Thank you. Well done. We worked hard for this today. With no lights you saw nothing but through binoculars and rifle scope it was bright. It was a very nice hunt and you see our two prototypes did a fantastic job.</caption>
	<caption start="936">The brightestbinocular, the brightest rifle scope. That is the proof. So you knew it was a gold medal did you? Yes. It couldn&#39;t have gone better for Ralph, and Paul and the new Zeiss Victory HT range. A vital piece of kit that occupies thousands of square feet here is the humble knife. Sporting Rifle editor Peter Carr spots a new range that really cuts the mustard.</caption>
	<caption start="963">Hi Bill. So, what&#39;s behind the innovation for this range? That&#39;s a great question Pete. A couple years ago we went out and followed a bunch of hunters, young athletic hunters and asked them what is the perfect knife, what would be the perfect product in the field so we went with three different guide surfaces and watched them what they did, and then designed something that we thought was very creative and innovative in the market place, something really different and new. So we went with the mid line.</caption>
	<caption start="990">Firstwe go with the Myth Fixed Blade Pro, gut hook, gripping handle, full tang, so it&#39;s a balanced product in your hand. Feel this.</caption>
	<caption start="1019">One thing we saw in the field was that they were always sharpening their knives, separate sharpener and the knife, so we introduced a new sharpening method so that every sheath had a sharpener, carbide, 30 degrees - fantastic, wonderfulvery quick, job to get done. It&#39;s clear that there&#39;s been some hunting kind of input to this, so you&#39;ve obviously developed them very well. We&#39;ve followed them a lot, we went back to them many times about size, shape, balance. Three or four times we went out and dialled it in to get the best knife for the hunter. It certainly caught my eye when Kevin showed me round originally.</caption>
	<caption start="1046">That&#39;s what was surprising, because a lot of the guys use small knives. They don&#39;t want to carry large knives out there, so we made like a peeling knife in the kitchen, full tang, flexible very flexible blade so it doesn&#39;t break. Even enough flex in there for filleting. Absolutely.</caption>
	<caption start="1071">What I liked for a general field knife for paunching rabbits, breasting pigeons and whenit is buddied up with a gut hook knife on a field combo it&#39;s absolutely perfect for taking out the backside of a deer and the length for even gralloching the deer is absolutely perfect. So it was clear to me that there was some thinking from a hunting perspective behind this.</caption>
	<caption start="1098">So, Peter, we took the small blade with the gut hook blade and combined it with a piggy back sheath and said hey look you can carry this one product, your sharpener, your twoknives, you can do anything from caping to gutting to field dressing. You can do anything you want with one unit and it stays sharp. Absolutely fantastic. And the field dress piggy back number here. The retail price for this in the UK? I understand it is GBP99 in the UK. It&#39;s absolutely fantastic. Across the hall is Leatherman. They are hopping up and down about a new version of their highly popular multi tool.</caption>
	<caption start="1128">One of them is so simple you can use it one hand behind your back,the other&#39;s been on a diet.</caption>
	<caption start="1157">So this is the new Rebar that&#39;s going to come out in about two months and we&#39;ll start shipping from the States worldwide and it&#39;s kind of the extension of our classic super tool look and feel, but it&#39;s a little bit slimmer so you can see it will fit nicely into a pocket, but you are still going to have all the basic tools that you need to really do a good day&#39;s work, a nice blade, some screw drivers, file, another blade on this side it&#39;s the firsttime we have put the replaceable wire cutters into a 4-inch tool and by that we mean the platform of the tool itself. So that will be coming out as I said in about months, looking at about GBP70.</caption>
	<caption start="1184">The Leatherman OHT which stands for one hand tool and this tool can be as it states opened with one hand and you just give it a flick there and it&#39;s got a sprung plier so that&#39;svery new for a one handed opening plier on the market. We took it a step further and everything on the tool can be opened from the outside so that&#39;s something new for this one handed plier concept. So I can do this and just open up my strap cutter like so.</caption>
	<caption start="1209">Everything locks and this will begin shipping in about the end of August beginning of Septemberso on the shelves in the UK about month after that. Looking about GBP95 or so. The gun trade is doing pretty well this year. The point about this show is to show new kit. Here is one gun maker that is victim of its own success. Shaun, lovely looking gun the K-80 Parcours from Krieghoff.</caption>
	<caption start="1234">Slightly embarrassing that it has sold out already for the whole of this year, isn&#39;t it?Yes, there was a production run which came to the UK of around 60 guns and worldwide around 120 and yes they are all sold. So if you want get them now or wait another year or so. Now Krieghoff make clay guns. They make clay guns. This is not entirely a clay gun. This gun is probably one of the first sporter design guns it also feels at home in the field as well which is obviously an advantage for a lot of shooters.</caption>
	<caption start="1259">They like a single gunand certainly in England we do a lot of game shooting and people like something they can go and do on a Sunday, shoot a few clays and on Saturday shoot a few pheasants as well, and this gun is in the weight sector which is in direct comparison with a lot of the other competitors and they will feel at home with it. Sheep are getting bigger and so are foxes. It&#39;s Team Wild TV. [music] Right here we go. There are three of us shooting tonight, well potentially shooting.</caption>
	<caption start="1291">So forthe first shot to be taken, we draw the cards. One&#39;s got driver on it, one&#39;s got shooter on it and one&#39;s got lamper on it. So it&#39;s all down to fate. Go on then you can go first, sir. Liddle-for-diddle.</caption>
	<caption start="1318">The Shooter is God The main aim of this evening is to try and find a fox which is making a right nuisance of itself at a local golf course, plus there&#39;s the added bonus of spotting some rabbits alongthe way. Once again I am using the NiteSite, this time on the top of my Ruger 77/17. It&#39;s fundamentally changed the way I approach shooting at night with or without a lamp. So we&#39;ll just have a scout around a bit and as soon as we see something, then I will load the rifle and take the shot then.</caption>
	<caption start="1347">Gives you an idea of just how clear the picture is throughthis night sight. This is what Team Wild really enjoys doing. Each of us knows what is expected of the other and it is a great way to spend an evening with your mates. We even get the chance to have a take-away. When we do lock on to the rabbits they are incredibly skittish, but eventually some sit just right for me. And he&#39;s down. Get in.</caption>
	<caption start="1378">But there is doubt in the ranks about the distances I am shooting. This is a pretty good shot. Now the guys won&#39;t say that, probably 110, 115 yards would you agree on that? 25 yards? 25 yards is about as low as it gets. The great thing is while we have been driving around with the NiteSite, as you can see the boys have had the red lamp out there trying to pick out their eyes, I&#39;ve had the night sight on the rifle completely unloaded, bolt open, and I&#39;ve been able to pick up a lot more movement.</caption>
	<caption start="1403">Now there areactually quite a few rabbits out there, but they seem to be shot pretty hard so as soon as they hear the engine or feel the vehicle coming along the ground, they are heading for the hills. Yhey are gone so, luckily, I could see their eyes, I could see where they were running to. Just a quickly tap on the roof and took a shot so a few more to go. So far, the NiteSite is proving invaluable.</caption>
	<caption start="1428">Time to focus on foxes. We fire up the fox caller and Steve gets into position. No opportunity here but squeaking on an edge of a woodland on another patch of land does provoke a response. A muntjac buck appears in the beam which of course we admire, but let walk on. Then we catch some eyes to the left of it, Keith is the man with the rifle.</caption>
	<caption start="1454">He hits the dog foxhard with the Ruger M77 and it drops on the spot. It&#39;s been a very long night, but eventually we got what we came for the golf club will be happy their fairways and greens are fox free. So it&#39;s been a great night. We&#39;ve worked pretty hard we&#39;ve been to quite a few of our favourite spots, but we haven&#39;t seen as much as we would have liked, but we&#39;ve got three cracking rabbits and a fantastic fox which Keith took there, our last knockings.</caption>
	<caption start="1483">I would say it&#39;s slightlyunlucky, as we spotted a muntjac buck there in the wood with the lamp and as Steve started squeaking the fox appeared behind it and it was very unlucky because Keith&#39;s got the rifle and that&#39;s not normally the result when Keith&#39;s shooting, but it&#39;s been a great night as I said. Five hours in the saddle, a lot of hard work, but looking forward to coming out again tomorrow night. For more information on the Ruger rifles visit www.vikingarms.</caption>

<title>Fieldsports Britain - First grouse of 2011, 30lb salmon, 21 foxes</title>
<captions>
	<caption start="29">[music] Welcome to Fieldsports Britain. Coming up: 20 foxes in a night. We ask: are vixens having two litters of cubs this year? We&#39;re at a catering college teaching the chefs of tomorrow how to prepare and serve game. First: the very best of Scottish sport. It&#39;s a Subaru-sponsored Macnab of venison, salmon and grouse.</caption>
	<caption start="61">[music] Ah Scotland - when better to embrace this land of sporting promise than August whenthere are so many options to choose from? There are the reds and the roe, the salmon and of course the grouse. We&#39;ve had a taster of all three in the past week. The stalking is for a future programme but we&#39;ve set ourselves the challenge of bringing all this fantastic game together in a brunch on the Glorious Twelfth. We want to prepare and eat the first grouse of the season anywhere in the world.</caption>
	<caption start="90">To do this we need a car sure-footed enough to get us to the river bank and the moor incomfort and with speed. So Subaru have given us a sparkly new Outback to play with. But no car achieves it&#39;s true potential without a gifted driver. Some say he can eat a fruit pastel without chewing it, a deep-fried doughnut without licking his lips, three shredded wheat is a breeze, his bloodtype is listed as tartan, he can hurl a haggis further than Fatima Whitbread and he regularly flings Fatima across the Firth of Forth - it&#39;s the McStig.</caption>
	<caption start="116">Otherwise known as Neil McGown, proprietor of the East Haugh House hotel near Pitlochry. He has the challenge of trying to catch a salmon and shoot a grouse all on the Twelfth. He then has to dash back to the hotel and prepare them before lunch. Normally Neil wouldn&#39;t have bothered getting his waders on let alone his tackle out because we&#39;ve had 24 hours of non-stop rain and the river is high - very high.</caption>
	<caption start="144">Neil has travelled all over the world in search of the big fish - but it was here on his ownback door that he landed his personal best in the spring run. Nice springer, 30lb, sealiced, caught on the fly and released as well, so it was a very exciting half an hour / three-quarters of an hour with a beautiful fish. In actual fact I saw the fish rise fully out of the water. I had a friend behind me.</caption>
	<caption start="173">I said: &quot;Did you see that fish?&quot; - He said &quot;No no&quot; - &quot;It&#39;s got to be at least 15lb, or 25lb / 30lb - beautifulfish. It looks as though it&#39;s on the run.&quot; Anyway six casts further on - voop - we&#39;re in, we&#39;re in! And it was that fish. It must have been that fish. So after about three-quarters of an hour Colin came up to help me land it, took some photographs, and then released it. It was a great day.</caption>
	<caption start="200">Your wife says you travelled all round the world to fish and you get the biggest on yourdoorstep. Yes - I go to Norway, I fished the Namsen, I fished Alta, hoping for the really big one and it&#39;s on my doorstep. Why do I have to venture to these places to fish when these fish are now coming back into the river systems? - which is great. It&#39;s a brave effort by the McStig but we go for the fallback plan. There are plenty of salmon in his fridge back at East Haugh House, but there certainly aren&#39;t any grouse.</caption>
	<caption start="227">We&#39;vegot to get one of those now. These gathering guns are the guests of Alan Thornton who has been shooting the Glorious Twelfth here for many years. We first joined him in 2009 for one of our first ever programmes. Then it took two hours to bag our first bird. We&#39;ll need to have better luck this time if we want to be eating grouse before anyone else. On the moor, gamekeeper David gives us the safety briefing.</caption>
	<caption start="252">He stalks the land but apartfrom a bit of pest control this moor is wild and the birds are left to do their own thing. No one knows what to expect. We get lined up - those on the outside will walk much further than those tucked in the middle and we will be walking for about four hours. It&#39;s hard work but surrounded by this scenery and with the anticipation of some of the most challenging birds in the world it&#39;s all worthwhile. Incredibly we walk five yards and some birds get up. The signs are promising.</caption>
	<caption start="282">Feeling confidentwe decide that Neil needs to shoot the bird that ends up on the table. We don&#39;t have to wait long. And he&#39;s off - taking a brace for good measure.</caption>
	<caption start="307">[music] Neil slams on the brakes and ditches the waterproofs for the whites. Neil has to prepare a dish incorporating salmon, red deer and our grouse. He starts with the salmon.</caption>
	<caption start="335">A fillet of salmon on a baby ratatouille with a prawn and white wine sauce and finishedwith a lovely West Coast of Scotland langoustine. Voila - looks good enough to eat - but we need to get that grouse on the heat. Neil has taken the breasts off the bird exposing the heather in it&#39;s crop. That&#39;s what it feeds on - heather. No way. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t hand rear grouse.</caption>
	<caption start="362">They&#39;ve tried to do in cages - young birds - and movingthe cages on the grouse moor and then trying to rear them that way but not been successful at all. Right here we go. A little bit of seasoning. I&#39;m doing this hot, virgin oil, extra virgin.</caption>
	<caption start="393">I&#39;m doing this as I said before with a full reduction and wild mushroom sauce on a hot radish mash. With the grouse resting, time to get the venison fillet in the pan. Just giving it a little bit of brandy. The two meats will complement each other on the one plate. Back on the moor and there are some interesting members in the party.</caption>
	<caption start="421">Graham Mackinlay isa well known Glasgow gunsmith and has a side by side that comes with some fascinating history. It&#39;s a Boss of London and I&#39;ve had it probably for ten years now. And probably regarded as one of the best side-by-sides in the world. And London-built.</caption>
	<caption start="453">It was built in 1918 and it&#39;s got some interesting provenance in that it once belonged to the surgeon who photographedthe Loch Ness Monster for the first time. So it&#39;s quite an interesting one. But - super gun to shoot with and, you know, I&#39;ll never part with it, so it will eventually go to my son George. They&#39;re beautifuly made. I suppose the balance of them is spectacular. Time check and it&#39;s 20 past eleven. We have to rest the venison.</caption>
	<caption start="482">Neil finishes the dishesJob done - the first grouse eaten in 2011 in the world - probably. All shot and on the table by half past eleven. But now the McStig is needed back up on the moor. The Argo delivers him to the line and we&#39;re off again. We are seeing lots and lots of birds which is great news - and a bit surprising for David at the half way point. Absolutely delighted with what we&#39;ve seen so far.</caption>
	<caption start="508">I mean, we counted this with fouror five pointers and to me it was just desperate. But we&#39;ve come out now and we&#39;ve walked half an hour and I think we&#39;ve flushed what 40/42 birds? Good coveys of eights and nines - so very pleased, absolutely delighted We&#39;ve also been selective with what we&#39;ve been shooting. What we do - the first covey to get up nobody shot at which was excellent because I shouted not to shoot because the grouse were too young - we call them cheepers.</caption>
	<caption start="536">You can visibly see they&#39;re smaller, they&#39;re not fully feathered, and we just let them be because again they&#39;llbe either for later on or next year&#39;s stock. Black grouse - they don&#39;t come in to the 20th of the month so, the wee black grouse, we&#39;ve seen one or two already this morning. We put up a grey hen with some youngsters again - there were just some small cheepers. We don&#39;t shoot the black cock or the grey hens - we just let them be. Lovely birds to see and their nice to see on the hill on a shoot day. With some welcome breathers we make it all the way round the moor. Most of the guns have had a shot, if not bagged a bird.</caption>
	<caption start="564">For Scott he&#39;s got his first evergrouse. He won this day&#39;s shooting in a charity auction. So does he appreciate why people get so intoxicated by grouseshooting? Excellent, fantastic day. Didn&#39;t really know what to expect but it was a super day. Four hours yomping around the hills made it all worthwhile. Great bunch of guys, great craic, couldn&#39;t have done better. And to get the first grouse on the first day on the first shoot was very memorable and a real privilege.</caption>
	<caption start="593">I&#39;d recommendit to anyone Thirteen brace. It&#39;s been a fabulously gloriously, Glorious Twelfth thanks to the birds and to the company, which is why Alan does this every year. We were thirteen guns in the line and thirteen brace - the bag for the day - mainly all young birds which is good to see. So, I think the boys did a good job as well. And it was spread out throughout the whole day as well.</caption>
	<caption start="621">It wasn&#39;t just a covey and then a long wait and thena covey. Good shooting all round and an excellent day Why is it important for you to do this? This is something that&#39;s obviously very dear to you. I believe this is my twentieth yearcoming to this very moor. And some of the team members have been coming all those years. So it&#39;s just a bit of tradition, first day of the season, getting out and about, having some fun and that&#39;s the start of the season. A few more grouse days to go, and then the pheasants and on it goes. We have fun.</caption>
	<caption start="648">Time to head back to East Haugh House, at a more sedate pace this time, for some food, drink and analysis of the day. In 2011 there&#39;s even enough birds for the guns to take some home. Let&#39;s hope other moors are producing surprises too. Now from the Scottish Moors to the Fieldsports Channel news stump.</caption>

We start this week with an exclusive and the League Against Cruel Sports has got egg on its face this week after two of its investigators were caught on their own covert camera.

	<caption start="724">It&#39;s believed SNH is forcing estates to shoot huge numbers of deer for what it calls &#39;conservation&#39; reasons, though many suspect it wants to make reduce deer numbers to a point that sporting estates will no longer be able to offer deerstalking.

	<caption start="778">Now, foxes. Have they had two litters this year? We&#39;re out with the legendary Roy Lupton on a red-letter night. Roy wants a big bag today and and he&#39;s got the kit to do it. This is a newly converted Land Rover Discovery - created not by BA Baracus but Brian.</caption>
	<caption start="803">Brian was given the Disco and spent a couple of hundred quid getting it an MOT and puttingin a new sun roof - not to increase daylight into the cab but to provide a perfect position to shoot those pesky foxes. &quot;Do you want it,&quot; he said, &quot;because it&#39;s worth nothing&quot;. So I said: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll have it&quot;. So I took it, got somebody to cut a hole in the roof.</caption>
	<caption start="830">The seat is an old centre seat from the back of a Land Rover 110 that I owned years ago and that I took out for the samepurpose. Yeah – so it&#39;s really come together for vurtually nothing - only the cost of having the hole in the roof. I&#39;m a bit longer in the body than Roy and I can sit on the seat and I can shoot off the roof. But Roy also like to use a bipod on his rifle so that means another four or five inches up. And he&#39;s a bit shorter in the body so we have his booster seat here all ready for him. Is it working for you? This is going to be our first time out, so hopefully we&#39;re going to christen it well.</caption>
	<caption start="860">It&#39;s not the easiest carriage to get yourself seated but once you&#39;re in it&#39;s the best seat in the house. The fox numbers have been extraordinary this year and the land we are going to tonight is Fox Central. There are two pieces of land we&#39;ll be shooting over but Roy wants to go all night and he&#39;s set himself a goal. I&#39;m hoping for a good night.</caption>
	<caption start="891">We&#39;ve got about 3,000/3,500 acres that is half way through cutting and we did one field the other night and got six on there and that was just about250 acres. So if we&#39;ve got that sort of fox density all over it then we could be in for a bit of a bumper night tonight. It would be nice to get twenty. We&#39;ll go for that and see how we do. It all depends whether our cameraman fades away a little bit. He&#39;s a bit of a jessie when it comes to staying out all night. We arrive and meet up with another of Roy&#39;s friends, Alex. As it&#39;s Brian&#39;s baby he&#39;ll christen the vehicle and will shoot first.</caption>
	<caption start="919">Roy will drive and handlethe lamp. We&#39;ll start off with the white light. If we&#39;ve got a fox that&#39;s jumpy then if you pick him up with that. We&#39;ve got an amber filter and a red filter to work with. As I say if we pick one up or pick a set of eyes up and he starts moving then we&#39;ll just use the amber filter on him. We mount up and the first field shows promise, but Roy has been here already as this was the first crop off this farm. They&#39;re a bit spooked here.</caption>
	<caption start="947">We don&#39;t waste time and make our way to what he thinks willbe the land of plenty. This is more like it. Brian opens his account but realises the shot can only be taken with the engine off. The V8 petrol is pretty steady but the diesel is not stable enough. Some of the foxes are keeping their distance. Others come right in. We soon have to stop to drop off the foxes we&#39;ve shot.</caption>
	<caption start="972">We have a pause. Already we&#39;ve had a successful night with Brian&#39;s seven - and he&#39;s happy with the Disco&#39;s performance and his own. The best night I&#39;ve had out on the foxes is six. And that was on a small area - only about 150 acres - but seven in this time that we&#39;ve spent tonight is fabulous. I&#39;m really pleased. And we stand the chance of shooting plenty more I think.</caption>
	<caption start="1000">One thing we are hoping to do by keeping on top of these animals is to improve the biodiversity of the local area. Apart from foxes we aren&#39;t seeing much else. We came in on this field and I&#39;ve never ever seen foxes like it. It&#39;s just ridiculous. We&#39;ve had seven so far and I don&#39;t know how many more we&#39;ve seen. We just going round, shooting, pick up another one, carry on. We&#39;ve had two foxes coming in from different directions at the same time on the squeak.</caption>
	<caption start="1029">As I say, I&#39;ve never seen a field like this. There&#39;s just foxes coming in from everywhere. And as we&#39;ve seen as we&#39;re driving around that&#39;s meant there&#39;s hardly any other wildlife on it. We&#39;re seeing very few skylarks, we&#39;ve seen no partridges, very few rabbits, no hares left. And that&#39;s just down to a huge population of foxes. Time for Brian and Roy to swap over. We go to the second field and Roy gets two within a matter of minutes.</caption>
	<caption start="1054">As well as foxes there are loads of badgers about too. It &#39;s been an incredible night and we lose count. [pause] When we lay them all out there are 21 carcases on the ground. Tired but satisfied Roy has delivered once again. He feels these fields had the potential to deliver and they have.</caption>
	<caption start="1082">He has surpassed his goal and achieved a personal best. Yeah - not a bad night&#39;s work. Bearing in mind we started at what? 10 / 10:30 and we finished up at half-past-two with 21. Some of them came in really, really well. We started squeaking and we had we had one group of three on the trot that came in. And others that weren&#39;t quite so obliging - we had to hunt them a little bit You could see the ones that knew the game of the lamp and knew what they were doing.</caption>
	<caption start="1110">And then we had some inexperienced ones as well. Just phenonomenal. I still can&#39;t get over how many foxes were over on basically two fields. Mindboggling the amount of foxes that are here. How many do you reckon we saw? So we shot 21. How many do you reckon we saw? 21 in and I suppose we probably saw about another 10 or 12 easily, so a good number of foxes out there.</caption>
	<caption start="1141">As I say, all of the agencies and rescue centres and whatever else that say that you only havea very small amount of foxes holding on territory: absolute pish. I mean, the amount of foxes that we saw out there tonight, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. And the Land Rover worked well too. The vehicle did well. Brian&#39;s conversion did well. I think we&#39;ve had a cracking night - a bit of a red-letter night. Time to go to bed. We&#39;ve got to get out and do some stalking in the morning. Roys thinks the number of foxes is high this year.</caption>
	<caption start="1166">There is talk of foxes having two litters thanks to the warm weather. Certainly cubs of different sizes have been seen all over the country. We&#39;d like to know what you think. Drop me a line charlie@fieldsportschannel.tv and we&#39;ll give you an update next week. Now to Hertfordshire where the restauarant chefs of tomorrow are learning how to dazzle restaurant-goers with game recipes.</caption>
	<caption start="1193">[music]Lee Maycock faces two tough problems. The kids he teaches about cooking game meat are generally tough, urban kids who wouldn&#39;t know a partridge from a pigeon. And the few of them who have tried game before have found it tough, because the world is bad at cooking game.</caption>
	<caption start="1221">Sponsored by the Countryside Alliance Foundation&#39;s game marketing programme Game To Eat, Leeruns one-day courses at catering colleges, teaching the chefs of the future about game. We join him on a course at Hertford Regional College, Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. Just a few miles from London, this as far from game habitat as you can get. The idea of today is try and give the students an understanding of where game comes from.</caption>
	<caption start="1248">What they tend to get when they order game is they will get it in a plastic tray coveredin cellophane. What we&#39;re doing is bringing game in it raw state, so it will be fur and feathered game, for them to get to look, understand, touch, feel, and essentially cook with, so they get a better understanding of obviously where it&#39;s come from originally. These students are not country lads and lasses. Only one of the 18 on the course today has used a gun before, out rabbit shooting with his uncle.</caption>
	<caption start="1277">They might see the odd woodpigeon, they might see the odd muntjac and possibly a pheasantif they get out into the countryside, but no they don&#39;t see a great deal - hence the reason this workshop is to try to give them an insight into what is out there, what&#39;s available. They&#39;ve all wanted to see more. We did skinning they were very interested in. We just cooked three or four dishes, and they absolutely cleared everything and said they enjoyed everything they tasted. That&#39;s the first time for a lot of them. They&#39;ve never seen a deer skinned, they&#39;ve never seen a pheasant plucked.</caption>
	<caption start="1305">They&#39;ve nottasted game So, for them it&#39;s all new - but they were very open-armed about welcoming the whole thing. Lee grew up in rural Oxfordshire. He now lives in Hertfordshire which is much more urban. If one or two - just - it makes them sit up and think this is something I could get interested in, this is something I would like to pursue and go and join a local gun club or something or just get themselves in the countryside a bit more.</caption>
	<caption start="1336">We&#39;re not going to tell everybody but all we need is ones and twos in these large groupsand it will make a huge difference. Then there&#39;s the matter of how to cook game. You talk to anybody in the street and they will tell you that game comes across as - you know - tough, dry and overcooked a lot of the time. And that&#39;s the big message we&#39;re trying to get across here is that it doesn&#39;t need to be overcooked. It&#39;s that just-cooked we&#39;re looking for. If you eat your steak rare, eat your piece of venison exactly the same way. Here&#39;s Lee&#39;s recipe for a carpaccio using any venison fillet.</caption>
	<caption start="1365">He uses a lean piece ofred deer meat, which is not considered as good as roe or, the best, sika. It still turns out delicious. Roll it in juniper dust, smoked sea salt and cracked black pepper. Roll it tight in clingfilm. Put it in the freezer for a couple of hours to let the salt start to do its work, to break down the enzymes. You can then eat that piece of meat like cured meat. No cooking by heat at all.</caption>
	<caption start="1393">Lee also demonstrates for the students a pan-fried pigeon breast with lemon crushed peas,a pheasant breast wrapped in bacon and served on a bubble-and-squeak and a loin of venison served with butternut squash and black pudding bonbons. Countryside Alliance - it&#39;s their campaign to promote British game - to promote consumption. Game was consumed last year on 57 million occasions, so it&#39;s definitely on the increase. If we can keep these workshops going, and educating youngsters, they can obviously carry on this tradition and we can all keep eating game for a long time.</caption>

<title>Fieldsports Britain - Night vision, quick duck and the Browning B725</title>
<captions>
	<caption start="29">[Music] Welcome to Fieldsports Britain. Coming up: We&#39;re launching a new Browning shotgun, We have a gentleman shot with a pair of Mirokus, We&#39;re shooting duck coming in below sea level to a line of wildfowlers. First: the best way to shoot rabbits is if you can see in the dark. Well, Dom Holtam has the technology...</caption>
	<caption start="54">For starters, we&#39;re going to take advantage of the last few hours of daylight on a farmnear Biggin Hill in Kent. Later, when it gets dark, we&#39;ll be off to Andy Crow&#39;s farm to try out the Nite Site that Sporting Shooter editor Dom Holtam has to play with. The Biggin Hill farm and its shoot are suddenly being over-run with roe. They need to be knocked back a bit - not eradicated - just to manageable numbers. They are probably attracted by the super bird feed which is going down here.</caption>
	<caption start="81">It&#39;s also attracting Crows. Nice - it&#39;s just a special feed that they feed here. It&#39;s expensive. Sultanas there - look. They eat sultanas. That looks better than my breakfast cereal, Andy I tell you what, if you were as hungry as I am you could eat this. It&#39;s got banana there - look. It&#39;s got bits of everything in it. It&#39;s all sweet stuff. And it&#39;s got, like, molasses in it as well. That&#39;s why it&#39;s sticking together. So that&#39;s good. Do the deer eat it? Deer love it.</caption>
	<caption start="107">I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s quite good. Is the food THAT bad at home, Andy? Don&#39;t put that on camera. I&#39;m absolutely starving. In between snacks, we keep our eyes peeled. There are plenty of slots but nothing on view.</caption>
	<caption start="132">With the setting sun silhouetting the racing-snake physiques of our wonderful team, Dom explainsto the lamp-loving Andy why he should have a go with Nite Site&#39;s night vision tonight. Then you watch the TV and that shows you what&#39;s being seen through the camera. So if you&#39;ve got your cross hairs, you&#39;re looking at the crosshairs through the screen. Yes. So you watch the screen and when the crosshairs are on the target you pull the trigger. In theory. In theory. In theory. We&#39;ll find out shortly, won&#39;t we? At least I&#39;ve got something to blame is I miss.</caption>
	<caption start="157">Andy sends Dom to the high seat where we hope the roe will materialise as the light goes. Hopefully nothing will be coming out on this side of the seat because I can&#39;t see anything. But anything that comes out in front should be OK. It&#39;s not up to the usual standards, this, for a fat bloke. Feels a bit fragile. Good job you are not up here, David.</caption>
	<caption start="185">Charlie Fox makes himself known, has a pee and makes sure everyone is aware that he&#39;s out and about. [Fox barks] He doesn&#39;t pee on our parade, but someone else does: a dog walker on a part of the farm he shouldn&#39;t have been. Jinx strikes again. Never go stalking with David Wright. Fact. I don&#39;t think the dog walker helped a great deal.</caption>
	<caption start="210">Or the fact that David has got a cough. I&#39;ve got a cough. Even the dog had a cough. So anyway... The fox had a cough. The fox was quite good. The fox was good. I should have shot the fox, really, shouldn&#39;t I? Anyway. There we are. Play with the Nite Site and hopefully we will have a bit more success with that. Can&#39;t be much worse. After refuelling Andy with some homemade soup chez Crow it&#39;s time to test the Nite Site.</caption>
	<caption start="240">Dom talks us through the set-up. So, we are back at Crowman&#39;s farm now with the Nite Site night vision system. Got sent it. I saw it at the CLA last year. It&#39;s basically a TV monitor. This bit. Night vision camera. And a mounting system that allows you to put these components on your rifle and day scope set-up. So, you don&#39;t have to change between dedicated night vision, dedicated day scope.</caption>
	<caption start="267">One size fits all. We&#39;re going to get it set up. It&#39;s got a battery pack you can take round with you. Various adaptors to fit various different sizes of scope. We&#39;re going to get set up now and see how we get on with it. The quality of the picture produced inside the barn by the powerful NS200 model is promising.</caption>
	<caption start="295">So, the advantages of this over a dedicated night vision system: obviously you don&#39;t haveto change your set-up. It took us two minutes. Exactly. Once you are familiar with it, you can just bolt it on and you are good to go. I can drop this off in two minutes and I can be using it in daylight. And when it becomes dark it takes me two minutes to put it on. This is... The original system I think had a range of about 50 yards. This has got a more powerful infra-red lamp and, apparently, it is good for about 200 yards. So, ideal for rabbit shooting and fox shooting.</caption>
	<caption start="321">I&#39;m not sure whether I would want to try it with a big recoiling .243 or something but I think for rimfires it would probably do the job. Of course the other problem: you can&#39;t hold it like a normal rifle.</caption>
	<caption start="347">So, you need to have a rest of some description, whether it&#39;s a tripod or a quad-pod or, obviously, in your case you have got your buggy, so you can rest it, and then it&#39;s a question of learning to trust whether or not that is going to hitthe point of impact, and I guess there is only one way to find out that. We&#39;re just going to do that. The image also looks good on first inspection in the darkness. Dom and Andy play with the brightness settings. The lowest setting... you see the image is getting brighter. It&#39;s basically like having a more powerful... ...lamp... ...torch put on, yeah.</caption>
	<caption start="372">Exactly. The UTV sags under the weight of the slimmer looking Dom but manages to make the field. The Nite Site does take a bit of getting used to. Even though there aren&#39;t many about we christen the new technology. If you had a barn full of rats... ...Oh yeah, it would be ideal... ...armed with an air rifle or something, you could sit in the pitch darkness. Especially these gas-operated air rifles.</caption>
	<caption start="402">The only time you can hear the shot is whenthe pellet hits something. Yeah. So they would be ideal for that, for shooting rats. Yeah, they would be brilliant. Once in the groove, Andy fails to miss and we have a huge bag of four to be proud of. So what does the natural born lamper think of going black-and-white? I think if you were sitting up a high seat, shooting rabbits out of a high seat, or if you got a problem with rabbits, you could sit up along a hedgerow it would be - well - I think it would be good.</caption>
	<caption start="427">To tell the truth for that it would be great. For riding round on the buggy... and it&#39;s the finding of them, like Dom was saying earlier, it&#39;s the finding of them. You need the lamp to find them. So, with me, I shoot with the lamp anyway. So for me it would be quicker to find them with the lamp, shoot them with the lamp.</caption>
	<caption start="452">But we are just playing around tonight, just experimenting, but I think sitting in a highseat or sitting up along a hedgerow shooting rabbits, I think it would be good. Dom also sees where this bit of kit is going to make the difference especially at the price. First time out, Andy has done the business, put a few rabbits in the bag. I think the important thing to stress with all night vision is that you can&#39;t just pick it up and use it straight away. You need to learn them. You need to work out how to get the best from them.</caption>
	<caption start="480">And I think that&#39;s definitely the case with this, especially the fact that you are not looking throughthe scope in a traditional fashion. Certainly got a lot of potential and a lot of potential uses. About GBP600, it is not much more than half the money of something like the Pulsar which is probably the best-selling of the modern night vision rifle scopes. The think I like about it it is that it means you don&#39;t have to give over a rifle specifically for night vision.</caption>
	<caption start="505">You can use it as your normal shooting gear and then, if you do need night vision,this bolts on in a matter of a few moments. I would like to experiment with it a bit more. I think it&#39;s got good potential for rat shooting, air rifle shooting. Definitely would like to experiment a bit more with the rabbiting and maybe a bit of fox shooting. So, yeah, pretty pleased with how it has gone for the first night and looking forward to having another go with it. So a versatile tool for anyone wanting to stay on top of their rat, rabbit, or fox problem.</caption>
	<caption start="532">For more information about the Nite Site system, visit www.nitesite.co.uk Now, someone else with something of the night about him. It&#39;s David on the Fieldsports Channel news stump. [Music] This is Fieldsports Britain news.</caption>
	<caption start="561">DEFRA minister Jim Paice has stepped in to stop the hooded crow being removed from thebird pest species list. His quick action followed lobbying by shooting organisations. The Countryside Alliance has hit out at the Government&#39;s proposal to build a high-speed railway line between London and Birmingham and then on to the North-West. It says HS2 will have a &#39;devastating impact&#39; on Britain’s countryside as it slashes through the Chiltern Hills.</caption>
	<caption start="588">Record salmon and grouse seasons have pumped more than £50 million into the Scottish economyfrom sporting lets alone in 2011. Grouse shooting accounted for £30 million of that figure, according to sporting agent CKD Galbraith. It was a record season for the wild game bird, especially in the Angus Glens and the Lammermuirs. And finally, awards for silliness in the national media, called the DAFTAs, have been announced by the website Newslite.</caption>
	<caption start="616">One runner-up in the animal section is the cross-eyed opossum Heidi from Leipzig Zoowho became famous last year and then died. Another is this well-endowed squirrel which shocked viewers when it appeared as part of covering footage in BBC Two&#39;s The Great British Bake-Off. But the winner - well-deserved in our opinion - is, of course, Fenton the dog from Richmond Park in London. You&#39;re now up to date with Fieldsports Britain news. Stalking the stories. Fishing for facts.</caption>
	<caption start="641">[Music]Thank you, David. That boy takes himself too seriously. Now, when John Prescott parachuted a new village on to he edge of farmland in Somerset, he probably didn&#39;t think about the local shoot. Well, this is how the shoot coped. Shoots get carved up by property development. Several shoots will be entirely destroyed by the plans for a high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham.</caption>
	<caption start="669">But some shoots takewhat central Government flings at them and they learn to work with it. When Milton Keynes was built, crime rates soars in the first five or six years. Until the village gets together, gets a community spirit, has people who stand up, put their heads above the parapet. And this has been repeated here. At one stage, the crime rate in Cotford St Luke was the highest in the West of England.</caption>
	<caption start="696">And we saw these boys. They came out twice to watch us shoot down there, so I went down one day to them and I said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you come and join us?&quot; And they have been with us ever since. The Heathfield shoot is a lovely family shoot in the heart of the Vale of Taunton. I&#39;m a great believer that on a day&#39;s shooting everyone should be having fun.</caption>
	<caption start="722">If it&#39;s a commercial shoot from the person who is buying the day down to the most junior stop: the man, youknow, tapping on a hedge somewhere, and he never gets seen. They all must be enjoying it for a day to go ahead. And I think it would be wrong and possibly unsustainable that if one section of the shooting party is not enjoying it then really it shouldn&#39;t be happening. We&#39;ve had good success in the last few years in bringing on I think now, well, certainly two young chaps who were totally new to the countryside.</caption>
	<caption start="747">One of them now has a fulltime job on a commercial shoot on the Dorset/Wiltshire borders and the other one has just gone to Harper-Adams agricultural college. Today we are shooting eight guns, not hitting much, happy when we do, having a lovely, lovely time. Pheasants, partridge, pigeon, woodcock and even a teal are counted in the bag. John Prescott is far from our minds.</caption>
	<caption start="774">And there are plenty of dashes of eccentricity to remind you that this is England, and wemust not be ashamed of enjoying ourselves. Yes - the shoot lunch table centrepiece is indeed a Bren gun. Richard runs the beating line but he is also a keen shot. A pair of Boss twenty-bore over-and-unders would cost you new about GBP140,000 at the moment? GBP150,000? I would have thought probably, yes. How much did these cost you? Well, I reckon the guns cost me, I think, GBP1,800-GBP2,000 each.</caption>
	<caption start="803">And then they probably had GBP600-GBP800 spent on the woodwork and the pistol grips. So you are a farmer with a bargain? You must be very happy. Well, yes. I think I am. They are lovely guns. All guns shoot straight. It&#39;s the person behind it which doesn&#39;t. So, no, they are great.</caption>
	<caption start="830">Richard and his father run a charming West Country shoot - but if they hadn&#39;t learntto cope with the new development which sprang up on the edge of their land, it could have been a different story. The shooting trade show season is about to start and there is a major new shotgun launch this week in Britain. It&#39;s the Browning 725. Andy Norris of Browning is one of the great characters of the British gun trade.</caption>
	<caption start="859">But can he actually shoot? We&#39;re at the awfully smart Royal Berkshire Shooting School&#39;s incredible grouse layoutto find out in front of an audience of sneering gunshop-owners. Well, today Andy has a secret weapon: the new Browning B725 shotgun. This is no time to mess it up, Andy! [Music] Well done, Andy. Fantastic.</caption>
	<caption start="884">725 forever. Fantastic. Well shot mate, that was brilliant. Gunshop owners are not easy to please. But they are giving the B725 the thumbs up. I&#39;ve been very impressed with it so far. It&#39;s much better than the pictures. And I am impressed with the handling, the trigger pulls. I think it&#39;s going to sell.</caption>
	<caption start="912">I think it&#39;s a very goodgun. I&#39;m very pleased with it. Andy, you are from Browning. You are supposed to be impressed with it. Well, I am impressed with it. That&#39;s my honest opinion. However, when someone like Chris, after 30 years in the industry, can give an opinion like that, then it really does tell us we are on to a winner. Something we already knew, but it just confirms it. Borrowed a gun from a clay ground? Chances are it was a Browning B425. Been to a posh shooting school like this one? It was probably a 525.</caption>
	<caption start="940">Now Browning has skipped two centuries and brought out the 725. So, what&#39;s it all about? Charlie, this is the new generation of what we call the B series from the legendary B25 range. It is called the 725 and pretty much every part of the gun is changed and has been redesigned. And we&#39;re previewing the new B725 game gun and the 725 Sporter.</caption>
	<caption start="966">We call it the S1 forSporter 1 in a Grade One format, and the Hunter 1, the game gun. For the first time ever we have made a deliberate differentiation between game and sporter. The characteristics and specification for both are completely different. Is that the way the world is going? I mean, on a Sunday... your arms are going to fall off. Yes Put them down.</caption>
	<caption start="992">[Laughs] Is the world splitting between your kind of Sunday clay shooter and your Saturday gameshooter? I think these days people are looking to specialise. You know - a lot of people specialist game shooters. A lot of people like their clays and target work. For the first time, we&#39;ve actually made quite a bit of difference with the two versions: a very specialised target gun and a very specialised game gun. Principal differences between the Sporter version and the Hunter version? The game gun is a more slender-looking stock.</caption>
	<caption start="1019">No palm swell on that one. Slightly lower in the comb. And the trigger pull on the Sporter is actually set at 3lb from the factory. The game gun is about 3lb 8oz. So, it&#39;s slightly heavier on the game gun, that is quite deliberate, but with the mechanical trigger now, the beauty of it is obviously the reliability but also the new design. The Browning guys at FN have worked for years to develop this.</caption>
	<caption start="1044">It&#39;s a verycrisp action, a very light trigger pull. People who have shot it already have commented on it&#39;s a big improvement over 525. And Browning of course is big on its surfboard graphics. Your engraving is very modern. Yes, well, I&#39;m glad you noticed that Charlie. We have deliberately aimed this 725 at the younger shooter, with a nice plain design using the orange colour. I think it&#39;s appealing to the younger generation, a design-led audience that we are now targeting.</caption>
	<caption start="1073">They are the futureof our sport. They&#39;re the guys we are trying to attract with our new designs. The Hunter, again, it&#39;s a very modern interpretation of a game scene. It&#39;s still a game scene on there: partridges and pheasants but again it&#39;s a modern interpretation of a traditional game scene. Everyone wants the B725 to do well. Double trap champion Stevan Walton is a Browning-sponsored shooter.</caption>
	<caption start="1099">It&#39;s trying to keep the tradition of the Browning while obviously bringing the new-age lookto it and the new technology of the chokes and recoil pads and everything else really to the new age, for traditional shooters and the up-and-coming new youth of today. The press is here, too. This is well-known shooting writer Vic Harker. New departure for Browning going for a low-profile action, though it&#39;s not that low. I think the market will be very interested. They&#39;re interested in anything that comes from Browning and I don&#39;t think this will be any exception.</caption>
	<caption start="1126">For the real answer, however, let&#39;s ask a shooting instructor. Nigel Muir works for the Royal Berkshire Shooting School It&#39;s the one-size-fits-all dimensions on these modern guns so, for most normal people, when they come for a shooting lesson, this will be perfect. Yeah, you can just pick that up straight out of the box and, without too much adjustment, actually shoot it quite nicely. Very nice.</caption>
	<caption start="1156">Next, out wildfowling with the Bridgwater Bay Wildfowlers in Somerset, it&#39;s Team WildTV. [Music] We&#39;re in the South-West of England, several feet under sea level on fields that are no more than a thin skin of peat that floats on the marsh. Jump up and down in one corner of a field here and a wildfowler in another feels it. This can only be described as a somewhat humbling experience for me. Although it&#39;s great fun.</caption>
	<caption start="1181">There are a lot of birds coming in. They are coming in thick and fast out of the gloom, really low and they are breaking early. There&#39;s this huge wind coming from behind us so I am having to double, triple, quadruple the lead on some of these birds just to get close to them. When you do connect with a bird it&#39;s like the first bird, the best bird you have ever shot. But at the moment, if you look at the cartridges strewn around the floor, I am not as successful as I had hoped to be. But there is still plenty of time.</caption>
	<caption start="1207">There&#39;s still plenty of time in the day as you can see. They are on you before you can even see them, so I can see why guys spend all of their winter days, every day after Christmas out here on these marshes. But, it&#39;s exciting fun. And these boys sure are dedicated. When I packed to come here, I expected to need waders and a handful of cartridges. We start the day in wellies and with our backs to an RSPB reserve.</caption>
	<caption start="1234">Under the watchful eyes of the early-bird birdwatchers, we enjoy some of the best duckshootingI have come across. Pack after pack of teal, widgeon, mallard, and one spectacular pintail come spinning in across the Somerset Moors, pushed by gale-to-storm-force wind. The morning is a real test for my kit. When it comes to wildfowling, it is absolutely essential you stay warm, dry and comfortable throughout the day. Now, this is January so it is pretty cold.</caption>
	<caption start="1261">It is not as cold as it has been in previous years - in fact the whole year has been reasonably mild - but still,when you are out there at 5.30 in the morning and it is raining sideways, you want to be warm and dry. Now, I have started wearing for wildfowling at this time of year my Rivers West Eider jacket and original bib. This is Rivers West&#39;s heaviest weight H2P fabric. It&#39;s completely waterproof and it&#39;s very comfortable. In addition to that, it&#39;s in Realtree Max 4 which is the world&#39;s finest waterfowling pattern, and it is also the same jacket I use for pigeon shooting.</caption>
	<caption start="1286">So the star performer today is this Armsan A612 semi-automatic shotgun. Now, I only received this last week from Viking Arms who have brought them into the UK. This is a Turkish-built shotgun. And I have been incredibly impressed with it, as soon as I opened the box. The build quality is outstanding, the finish is superb and, given the fact it is a budget shotgun, it is only GBP550 it retails for, it is also packed full of really cool features.</caption>
	<caption start="1312">26 inch barrel, multi chokes, 3 inch magnum chambered and, as you can see, fantastic chequering,it&#39;s an incredible all-round shotgun and I am looking forward to taking it on my next pigeon shooting outing, too. The kit helped me help myself to the duck. However, while the duck poured in, the snipe were hard to find. And, once found, they were even harder to get a shot at. Added to that, bridges were down.</caption>
	<caption start="1337">We&#39;ve come to have a look at these drainage ditches here but unfortunately the culvert - the bridge - has been taken out. There is some fairly deep water there. Although I think I am athletic enough to leap over, I don&#39;t think my hosts are, so we are going to head on and find somewhere else that is a little bit more easy going. Stuart is a larger-than-life character: warm, friendly and absolutely passionate about wildfowling. I first met him at the Midland Game Fair. Like all wildfowling club chairmen, he has to deal with knotty issues.</caption>
	<caption start="1364">His knottiest is nuclear. Clearly you&#39;re a passionate wilfowler, but you also put an awful lot of effort into the club. Just how much effort goes into bringing this kind of shooting together and what happens behind the scenes? Because I don&#39;t think people really appreciate what it takes to make all this happen. No, the hours that I spend, and if you speak to the wife she will no doubt elaborate on that in more depth.</caption>
	<caption start="1393">But just lately it seems like this is the only piece of real estatein the whole country. I&#39;ve explained to you that we have got the big new first-generation PWR to be built. Just round the corner by our land there are two lots of &#39;managed retreats&#39; which, if they come into existence, and it looks like they will be, they will be the biggest managed retreats in the country, and I am sorry about how you feel but we want to put some windmills up? Stop the shooting. We want a solar farm? Stop the shooting.</caption>
	<caption start="1418">We want a managed retreatwith European money that we pay? Stop the shooting. So, we have got to be there pushing and holding the rights, the traditional rights and the traditional pursuits of people that wildfowl. The real excitement is reserved for the last call of the day. We walk up the drainage ditches, known locally as &#39;rhynes&#39; looking for springing teal. Most people know about springing teal from clay pigeon shooting.</caption>
	<caption start="1445">But this teal is thereal deal. That to me is some of the exciting sport. And I have used the term ditches. We use the term rhynes here. It&#39;s a common name for them. And you saw that we walked right up to the ditch, thought - just about to drop our guns - thought there is nothing there. And you get twenty teal come up and you snap shoot and, well, you had a right and left. It was extremely exciting, yeah.</caption>
	<caption start="1471">It is so much fun and excitement but it is not a sure thing. And you can tell from the shooting. Bridgwater Bay wildfowlers are welcoming, ordinary blokes who love their sport. This is not just a weekend jaunt. To these people, it&#39;s a way of life.</caption>

<title>Fieldsports Britain - Geese, muntjac and white rhino</title>
<captions>
	<caption start="29">[music] Welcome to Fieldsports Britain and this week we&#39;ve got people with problems. Top stalker Oliver Power has a problem finding game in undergrowth. Luckily he has the right scope to do it And if he has any problems in the field he&#39;s also allowing us a sneak peak in his stalking backpack. I have a nice seat to keep my bottom from the wet and the mud and the &quot;oomps&quot;.</caption>
	<caption start="57">People all over the world have a problem withshooting rhinos. But is it OK if it&#39;s done in a sustainable way? We ask a Danish big game hunter.</caption>
	<caption start="82">First, Andy Crow has a problem of agricultural proportions with geese Farmer Andy Crow has to defend his crops from ground and air attack - rabbits and deer are the main offenders advancing over his fields,with the FAF - the Feral Air Force - showing no mercy from the skies. But at this time of year it isn&#39;t just the fighter pigeons wreaking havoc on the winter wheat. Bomber Command is also peckish - geese. There&#39;s a muddy puddle on the farm which is seeing a lot of air traffic. Some days Andy is counting up to sixty geese, so he has arranged for a friendly ack-ack battery to try and shoot down a few this morning..</caption>
	<caption start="110">Sporting Shooter magazine editor Dom Holtam is here sporting a very handsome moustache - known as a &quot;trucker&quot;. Practically a &quot;Freddie&quot; It&#39;s for charity. What? You not heard of Movember? It&#39;s for people with testicular cancer. It&#39;s to raise aware ness and money for charity. I mean, not an issue for you - you haven&#39;t got any.</caption>
	<caption start="138">Then there&#39;s Mr Crow himself doing his bit for charity. Poppy Appeal. Help for Heroes. So what&#39;s the plan? Well, we all got here early this morning. We&#39;ve got about sixty or seventy Canada geese coming in to a pond which we&#39;ve got on the farm here. Been a bit of a problem at the moment.</caption>
	<caption start="165">Got a bit of winter wheat on the edge of the pond and they seem to be grazing itoff. So this morning we&#39;re just going to try and thin them out a bit. They do come in in two lots. As you can hear, one lot&#39;s just coming in now, so better get on and get out there and get ready for them coming in. Andy and his cousin Gary take cover in the reeds. Dom and Justin have the hide under the oak. Thankfully for the camera the geese are late and there is some light when we hear the first, distant honks. If you have never experienced it, please make the effort to have a go.</caption>
	<caption start="195">It really does getthe blood pumping. [gun shots] Everyone has a shot, a few hit the deck and Amber is off after them. After another 10 minutes we start seeing geese arrive in smaller numbers, making them easier to single out.</caption>
	<caption start="226">[gun shots] In all we have ten birds on the ground.</caption>
	<caption start="253">Crowman talks us through the technique and the shells used today as he can&#39;t use lead on English wildfowl. Plan was today for the lads to take the first shots as they are coming in. Me and Gary shoot as they go out. As for cartridges, well, we&#39;re using Eley VIP Steel and the bismuth - a combination of either of the two. Eley have given us some to try out. They work well. We&#39;ve shot a few geese.</caption>
	<caption start="280">Even shooting over ponds you still have to use the steel and the bismuth andthey seem to perform well. What about technique? Technique? They miss them and me and Gary shoot them. That&#39;s the technique. Dom&#39;s over there. He&#39;s worked really well as a bird scarer. I will say that Dom did shoot a couple. That&#39;s the technique. Dom scares them. We shoot them. And you can see we&#39;ve got a nice bag full. What about lead and things like that? Lead? Forget the body.</caption>
	<caption start="305">It takes a lot of pressureto get the shot through the down and the feathers. Just ignore the body. Come from behind. It&#39;s the head you want to be hitting. You want to get right up the front end. You want to shoot it as if it&#39;s a small bird. They&#39;re travelling fast as well, so you have really got to get through them, but it&#39;s the front end you want to be hitting. As we line out the birds, Crowman can&#39;t help noticing the number of pigeons moving over head. One flock comes low and there are so many birds you can hear them.</caption>
	<caption start="331">[bird wings] It&#39;s all part of the seasonal migration. A lot of people don&#39;t agree when I say they migrate. Anyone that is into pigeon shooting and knows their pigeons, they do know they do migrate. They migrate in their thousands. Like, Monday, coming through here, strange really, there were going from south to north and usually this time of year they are going from north to south. But they were coming through.</caption>
	<caption start="358">There must have been in excess of 20,000 pigeons coming through on Monday, justhedge-hopping and just moving through. A pack of pigeons going over the top now. They are just coming through all the time. Here is the damage that has been done by the geese. A good acre has been munched over the last few weeks. This week, I have put a bit of corn on the pond just to keep them off of this because they were going through it like a flock of sheep.</caption>
	<caption start="385">At the moment, it&#39;s so mild the cornis still growing, so it getting away with it. It will come back. But if they just stayed there all winter they would just strip this field. Then once they have finished this field they would just go and do the next field. I&#39;m quite lucky. I can keep them off. But a lot of the farmers down on the marsh and that, they get hundreds of geese on their fields and just graze them off. Good for Christmas? Yeah good for Christmas.</caption>
	<caption start="411">I read it in one of the shooting magazinnes - I think it musthave been the Sporting Shooter - some chap reckoned you put a brick in the oven and a Canada goose, and chuck the goose away and eat the brick. I&#39;ve eaten a hell of a lot of geese and I haven&#39;t found one that tastes like a brick yet. Dom has shot his first ever goose today - so has he enjoyed this type of shooting? I do enjoy it. It&#39;s quite exciting.</caption>
	<caption start="436">Becaus they are so big and make so much noise whenthey come in, it&#39;s quite exciting really. I can see the appeal of people going out on to the foreshore and shooting out on the marsh. It must be really haunting hearing them coming in, in a lonely landscape, but easier to carry them back to the farm.</caption>
	<caption start="461">Christmas has come early - only this time these geese are getting fat thanks to Crowman&#39;swheat. And the guns are going to put on a few extra pounds with a proper farmhouse breakfast. What a way to start the day. Geese there - a &#39;fly in the ointment&#39; for any farmer. And Andy Crow, more than a &#39;thorn in the side&#39; of the geese. Now, let&#39;s go to a &#39;tin tack in the toe&#39; of the antis. It&#39;s David on the Fieldspoorts Channel new stump.</caption>
	<caption start="487">[music] This is Fieldsports Britain News. Just 35 per cent of local councils know where the food they serve schoolchildren comes from. The Countryside Alliance Foundation wants the Government to bring in a minimum British food-buying standards policy for schools, similar to that it began for the civil service earlier this year.</caption>
	<caption start="514">This, while British game meat is becomingever more popular. A chip shop in Norfolk has found a new dish to attract diners. French&#39;s chippie in Wells-Next-The-Sea now serves deep-fried pheasant. A Chinese petrochemicals billionaire has become the first person in China to own his own island - and he has just opened it up as a put-and-take hunting reserve.</caption>
	<caption start="542">He has released wild boar, pheasants, and barking deer on the 200-acre island in theEast China Sea. He charges £12 to enter, £10 to rent a rifle and £1 per bullet. Is it a crocodile? Is it a huge snapping turtle? Is it a publicity stunt? The River Lea Monster is back. A houseboat resident on the river which passes through London&#39;s Olympic Park witnessed an attack. To our amazement, one of the geese just went vertically down into the water.</caption>
	<caption start="572">Mike Wells says it is more likely to be a turtle than a crocodile It was big, whatever the hell it was because there was so little hesitation. But Mr Wells has another axe to grind. He campaigns against the Olympic Park development. Fish kills that they have already had are due to the fact they have impounded the waterways in the Olympic Park. You are now up to date with Fieldsports Britain News. Stalking the stories. Fishing for facts.</caption>
	<caption start="606">Thank you David, who is of course availablefor weddings and Bar Mitzvahs. Now, some of you are going to like this, not all of you are going to like it, but would you defend this fellow&#39;s right to do it? We&#39;re taking a look at rhino shooting We were up at 4 o&#39;clock in the morning the day the rhino hunt... Torben Espensen is a successful Danish businessman, a hunter and a gun collector.</caption>
	<caption start="633">Along with Sir Jackie Stewart and Wilbur Smith, he is anambassador for the World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities. We meet him in Sweden where he tells us about his passion for trophies and justifies how he travels the world in pursuit of some of the planet&#39;s most endangered animals - in particular the rhino. You specialise in endangered animals. That&#39;s not very nice.</caption>
	<caption start="661">Well, it depends what type of glasses youhave on. Asking me a question like that, the first thing I would accuse you is having blinkers on. Because you actually don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. Well, tell me. What&#39;s going on? Today, most of the hunting around the world is very regulated, controlled, at least in most of the countries.</caption>
	<caption start="686">And what the anti-huntingpeople do not understand is that if it were not for licensed hunting we wouldn&#39;t have any game left. Torben has given us permission to use footage from his white rhino hunt in South Africa in 1998. After four hours of tracking two bull rhino he has the opportunity to shoot. After it was all over, he said to me, &quot;Thank you Mr Espensen.</caption>
	<caption start="713">&quot;And I was looking with a big question mark and I said: &quot;For what?&quot; &quot;For the act you just done. You shot a rhino.&quot; I said: &quot;Yes.</caption>
	<caption start="738">&quot; &quot;Are you aware that without people like you we would not be able to maintain the stock of rhinos we have? Because about eighty per cent of the trophy fee you are paying is goingback to maintain the wildlife.&quot; And this is one of the things that the anti hunting people do not under stand. If he doesn&#39;t have that money to go back to the trade, and to maintain the wildlife, we wouldn&#39;t have anything left. Because then everything will be open for poaching.</caption>
	<caption start="763">By the end of the day, we will just look at an empty world with nogame. Is that what they want? There is an expression that the Americans say: &quot;If it pays it stays.&quot; I guess you paid a great deal of money. Can you say how much? Half a farm. Half a farm? Yes. For a single animal? Yes. Why? When I was 14, I had my confirmation and an uncle gave me a book.</caption>
	<caption start="791">It was a travel description from an English lord and her ladyship backin the middle 1800s going to Kenya on safari. But in that book there was this scene of a rhino hunt. I mean, I am 14 years old, and I was sitting in my tiny little room, and I wasn&#39;t reading the book actually. I was eating it. But I swore, at 14 years old, I am going to have that experience some day in my life. It took me more than half a lifetime to get there.</caption>
	<caption start="820">When I celebrated fity years, I made up mymind. I&#39;m going to fulfil the dream I had when I was 14. So I said to friends and family: &quot;I don&#39;t want any gifts. I want cash or cheques. I&#39;m going to save for a rhino.&quot; Then in 1998 I fulfilled my dream. And, actually, to say it plain and open, I was crying. I lifted my head and looked up and said, &quot;Thank you&quot;. Emotion took over.</caption>
	<caption start="846">It was a fantasticday for me. OK - bongo, Nubian ibex, southern white rhino, crocodile. You are not a bad person? No. I benefit to the preservation of them. Tanzania is in full speed to - they have more or less copied the situation in South Africa.</caption>
	<caption start="875">A lot of the money we pay in trophy fees is going back to the trade, to maintain gamekeepersand anti-poaching groups and stuff like that. Because if we don&#39;t do that, the animal is going to disappear. What about all the animal watchers - the tourists who go and look at animals instead of shooting them.</caption>
	<caption start="901">That&#39;s an income for the trade in the countires as well, but the problem here is these animalsare not really wild any more. To me it doesn&#39;t mean anything any more. I can see a cheetah or a lion lying four metres from a car. They are so used to it some of the wild has been taken out. Most of my animals have been taken in real wilderness. That&#39;s where I see the challenge. And to me, to be a hunter, the way I see it, I think it&#39;s a privilege.</caption>
	<caption start="926">I&#39;mvery grateful that the good Lord has let me do that. For more about the World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities, visit www.wfsa.net Now, packing for your stalking outing can be a bit tricky. It needs to be light, quiet and cover everything from water to waterproofs.</caption>
	<caption start="954">Well, top stalker Oliver Power from the EnglishSafari Company has honed his kit over the years. What secrets lie within? I&#39;m quite an apathetic stalker and try to refine what I put in my kitbag. When I take clients out or I&#39;m on my own, I want something lightweight, durable - because I do thrash my kit around - so this is the stuff in here I&#39;ve sort of compiled over the last few years.</caption>
	<caption start="980">These particular gloves are air pilot gloves. The reason why I have these is because they are very thin leather and you can really feel the trigger when you need to shoot, basically. I have a nice seat to keep my bottom from the wet and the mud and the &quot;oomps&quot;. It just folds out like that. It&#39;s a very good piece of kit, especially when you are stuck up in a high seat, and it&#39;s just hard wood against your arse.</caption>
	<caption start="1007">Bit of tissue - wipe off the blood off your knife or some clients like to go and behave like bears in the wood. One thing we can&#39;t do without but I am usually wearing these all the time - these wonderful Zeiss binos. Don&#39;t go stalking if you leave these at home. Bottle of water, in case I&#39;m thirsty. Also it&#39;s got a bit of a jet bit, get a bit of force to wash blood off the knife with.</caption>
	<caption start="1032">First aid kit. Indispensible. Leading on to safety aspects, mobile phone - indispensible. If somebody decides to go and shoot themselves, you can call for an ambulance straight away. Also just letting landowners know that we are here. Some like twenty-four hours notice - or just like being in contact with you. Rangefinder. I consider this a bit of an optional item.</caption>
	<caption start="1059">It depends where I am stalking and howfar I allow clients to shoot, and just judging certain distances. Another essential piece of kit is this wonderful system with a hook on it and a saw that I can get through, and it has a long strap on it for dragging, and also it&#39;s very good if you want to do a gralloch out in the field and suspend the deer up. Long hook like that.</caption>
	<caption start="1085">Dragging under the chin. This is the knife I use the majority of the time, which is a standard blade in here. And then it has a locking device I can swing out. I have a belly hook. I have a Surefire torch. I think they are the best torches on the market. Buttolo call.</caption>
	<caption start="1112">I carry this six months of theyear, for the roe rut and also for calling muntjac as well. Harris bipod - absolutely indispensible. Usually on my rifle. I also have a steel for my knife. And a fistful of rubber gloves. Always need them to keep the blood away - mess away and everything - absolutely essential to keep a fistful of rubber gloves.</caption>
	<caption start="1137">Lighter - always useful for wind directionif there are eddies in the woodland and stuff. Just predicting gthe wind. Always an essential piece of kit. This is my waterproof poncho. Some clients don&#39;t come out in the most waterproof - and if I am feeling very generous I will lend it to them and I will stand looking wet and soaked like an old dog. And your own jacket? Yes. This Swazi jacket is bombproof.</caption>
	<caption start="1164">Reallyis. Totally water resistant, wind resistant, very durable, minimum noise. One of the best stalking jackets you can buy on the market. Now we know what to take with us, it&#39;s time to put some of the kit to the test. One new item Oliver now carries with him is this Aimpoint sight. He&#39;s hoping it may come into its own today as we are after muntjac.</caption>
	<caption start="1192">This interesting little deer is at home in the undergrowth and, unless you get a clearshot of him down a ride you have to react quickly. A telescopic sight may not be the best thing to use. The Aimpoint could solve a lot of problems. I&#39;ve changed over scopes now because we are going in a partiuclar thick pieve of woodland where we are shooting between five and fifteen metres. And I really think the Aimpont sight helps me far better than a standard scope.</caption>
	<caption start="1219">I can pick up the rifle, the red dot can beplaced on the animal, and I can knock it down straight away. The muntjac are very nervous in this particular woodland and I need to cull them out. And it gives me an instant picture when I want to shoot them, instead of the scope which takes a little bit of timing to get the crosshairs. Once I get the red dot on the muntjac, I can fire and make a knock-down.</caption>
	<caption start="1245">Unfortunately we don&#39;t see or hear any muntjacin this part of the wood - so we head off - leaving the sticks behind. This Elmer-Fudd-style of stalking is not something we see a lot of over here but on the Continent the Aimpoint is often used for driven and walked-up game. As a shooting aid, I feel more confident shooting with this Aimpoint sight than I do with normal iron sights. I practise with this on the range, on running target and static.</caption>
	<caption start="1274">You have to shoot with both eyes open, so when you raise it up andsee the game running you can just get on it straight away. You would imagine the one disadvantage of the sight is range - long distance shots being out of the question. However when we spoke to Aimpoint president Lennart Ljungfelt, he said &quot;Not a chance,&quot; and sent through this latest trophy shot from Alaska. This moose was 200 metres away and was shot with an Aimpoint H34S. The S stands for short.</caption>
	<caption start="1304">From mighty moose to the midget muntjac, we are back at base getting ready and waiting for dusk. Oliver likes his home comforts and sets up his new Bog-Pod Tipi which hangs off his sticks - it gives us cover and a bit of shelter if needed. Getting in the mood he even sends up a few smoke signals. We talk about the why the muntjac is such an exciting animal to stalk yet often gets a bad press.</caption>
	<caption start="1335">I mean I would like to see muntjac not as highly ranked as roe - I don&#39;t think you couldever knock roe off the top post - but I think it&#39;s a very important species that we now have in our countryside. I think it&#39;s wonderful sport. The thing never stays still. It&#39;s a real competitive edge. It&#39;s always bobbing and weaving, never really standing still, especially in this kind of dense woodland. It&#39;s just gives another element of skill towards stalking in a way.</caption>
	<caption start="1365">Whereas roe will come along and stand and stare atyou, you rarely get that opportunity with muntjac. With nothing happening we&#39;re off on the hunt again - free style. Losing the telescopic sight does make it a far more fluid, flexible, protean experience. This time we do spot something. It&#39;s &quot;Charlie&quot; - and Oliver is on to him straight away. And thank goodness - he is a mangy old thing.</caption>
	<caption start="1392">Sometimes it&#39;s a necessity when you&#39;re a deerstalkerwhen landowners ask you during the pheasant shooting season to sort out the foxes. And we have come across one very manky, manged-up old Charlie, who we despatched with a a 6.5x55 156-grain Oryx round and, as you can see, it dropped it straight on sight. If you want to find out more about the Aimpoint range go to www.aimpoint.</caption>

So we thought while we are down here and as we were getting up at some ungodly hour we thought we would make the most of it and see what else we could account for. Before the grey we&#39;re after reds, don&#39;t panic we are talking foxes.</caption>
	<caption start="107">The shepherds been saying that a couple of foxes have been coming in and the lambs aredue out so we are going to tuck up down there and what I want you to do, I&#39;m going to be facing out this way I want you to look back up the bank because one might come along from a standing briar further up so if you&#39;re ready when they come along there.</caption>
	<caption start="134">For some reason a herd of deer are scooting around us, but they don&#39;t stay still enoughfor a shot. They are coming down here. I don&#39;t know why but I am guessing a dog walker has come in along the top and the dog has probably chased them and spooked them.</caption>
	<caption start="160">Roy repositions just in case they cross the bottom of the valley. Again they are not stopping for anyone, especially Roy. See I got into position but they weren&#39;t going to stop were they. Couple of young bucks in there. They were definitely spooked. I don&#39;t know quite what has been going on up there, but something has come through and disturbed everything in there. Now we&#39;ve probably ruined the foxing, but you should never deviate from the plan.</caption>
	<caption start="198">Back to plan A and foxing, but for a change the call doesn&#39;t get a response. Roy wants to head to the other side of the estate for another squeak before the dog walkers really start getting the wildlife on edge. This time its the air rifle out of the slip, but it&#39;s the pigeon giving Roy the slip. Eventually he stays still long enough for a shot. Finally, there is something for our efforts.</caption>
	<caption start="224">Now in woodlands the shotguns make an appearance. We see at least half a dozen dreys as we stalk through it. Now we have got to get on with the main job which we came here for this morning which is having a go at the squirrels. It&#39;s a shame actually because we were going to try and do quite a few with the air rifle before we started off with the shotguns, but as we were stalking through the woods this morning you could see that the squirrels were just up and away.</caption>
	<caption start="251">Again they were just very very jumpy this morning so we&#39;re going to go and do somedrey bashing and see how we go.</caption>
	<caption start="280">You can do it one of two ways you can either have a drey poking pole which if you are flushing squirrels for birds, yeah, I mean you can fly female red tails and some fly Harris hawks on them if you are poking them out like that and it can provide really good sport, but you do have to be incredibly careful if you are flying squirrels with a bird of prey as they do bite quite badly, so this morning we&#39;ve not brought the drey poker with us becauseall we&#39;re going to do is put a shot through the drey, that either kills the squirrels in the dray or at least flushes them and when they start flushing and running through the trees we&#39;ll pick them off so this is just purely a pest control operation this morning. We have just got to try and get the numbers down before the leaf gets up on the trees. No nobody home.</caption>
	<caption start="306">Nobody home Nobody home in that one. That looked quite promising though didn&#39;t it? That was a nice fresh one. Roy allows Jim to have the first shot and he is there to deal with any runners.</caption>
	<caption start="334">Notall dreys have anyone at home, but for some there is a rude awakening. Jim is pretty tentative picking up the squirrels much to the amusement of Roy. I can&#39;t believe that you have been manned out by David. I didn&#39;t see it, David found it. Why are you holding it like that? Honestly it&#39;s dead it&#39;s not going to hurt you mate.</caption>
	<caption start="359">Honestly look, see? This squirrel won&#39;t hurt you. Yeah, lovely. But with these rodents, once bitten twice and thrice shy and he has the scar to prove it. Are you traumatised by that, it must have hurt a lot.</caption>
	<caption start="392">You&#39;ve no idea and next time you say a squirrel won&#39;t hurt you I&#39;ll wince in pain cause I know he will, little whatsit![gunshots] The other thing to remember when you are doing this sort of work is that obviously if we left it any later then the birds would be nesting and there&#39;s a chance you could mistake a drey for a nest up in one of the trees or something like that so really you want to do it before any of the birds have started laying and just run through. So we are sort of pushing it now. In another few weeks you really wouldn&#39;t want to be doing it.</caption>
	<caption start="422">The most Roy has had out of the wood is 15 so, for a short morning we haven&#39;t done too badly, especially as Jim has all his fingers. For more on air rifles tune into Team Wild TV because they have a new film this week. Just click on the angry buck. [stag roars] Now from one furry woodland friend to another.</caption>

	<caption start="562">[music]Thank you David. Now kids and guns. What a great mixture we are at the first event of the 2012 Schools Challenge. More than 180 children and youths from schools across England are here at the Oxford Gun Company competing for £12,000 worth of prizes today. Here&#39;s one of them, Megan Bates, from Bredon School in Gloucestershire.</caption>
	<caption start="590">It would be nice to be in the prizes, but it&#39;s the second one I&#39;ve done so far so hopefully,I have had a couple of lessons and that&#39;s good. So this is all about taking part? Yes, yes. It&#39;s very big of you. I was expecting you to say no, I want to win [laughter] It would be nice to win, but it&#39;s the taking part that counts and it&#39;s just nice to come out and meet people within the shooting industry and get to know people around the course. Megan&#39;s brother is punchy about his chances.</caption>
	<caption start="618">It&#39;s my first School Challenge competition, but I have shot a lot recently so I am hopingto put the team up and hoping the team will win. How do they prep you for all this? Do you have shooting lessons at school? I have been shooting at school for four years now and I have been shooting since I was tiny and coming up here since last July with David Florent having lessons and previously I have been here on Monday practising hard, ready for the day ahead now.</caption>
	<caption start="644">Last year&#39;s winners of the two main schools challenge events are Millfield school andWarwickshire College. These lads from Seaford College in West Sussex reckon they are in with a chance. I think a good chance not too bad, yes. Millfield and Warwick College, both winners from last year, are you worried? We beat them one year so we can beat them again. They have always been our main competitors, but I think as Ali just said years ago we beat them so I think we can do it again.</caption>
	<caption start="672">Are you happy with the way you have shot so far? We only shot one so we&#39;ll see how we do on this one. It&#39;s not all private schools. Kineton High has produced schools challenge winners. There are lots here like Megan who are interested in the competition for individual glory. Now we are in a shocking situation because Charlie you are on 35, Alex you are on 45.</caption>
	<caption start="698">Should you be quite proud of that score?[Laughter] No he shouldn&#39;t. He should have straighted it, he shoots every day of his life. [Laughter] Alex is that true? Should you have straighted it? Uh, yes, really because the ones I dropped were silly mistakes, all of them. Now you are on the edge of your seat because one of these guys could score, 46, 47, 48... Yeah ...And that would be bad because then you wouldn&#39;t win.</caption>
	<caption start="723">Yeah But you reckon you are in with a chance to win? Yeah, hopefullyAnd do you hope that Alex will win, Charlie? Yes I do, yup, yup, he&#39;s a team mate, so He&#39;s a team mate even though he is from a different school? Just because we&#39;re from..... Brilliant, all right, well good luck this year. We&#39;ll see how it pans out. Thanks. But the best reason to be here is for the fun of it.</caption>
	<caption start="749">Are you off to shoot the Rabbitmania now? Yes, we shot it this morning, but we&#39;re going back to have a go at pool shooting in therabbit mania. OK fantastic. This is a fun day isn&#39;t it? Yes. You&#39;re here to enjoy yourselves. Yes. It&#39;s great. We&#39;re back because we like it, we love it. Now, a prize pot like the one assembled by the Oxford Gun Company is only possible with the generous help from sponsors. Rather than get them to explain their products to you we have set them our own Fieldsports Channel challenge. In a TV game show format taken straight from a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta we have asked them to pair up and change roles.</caption>
	<caption start="775">First up is a gun maker and a clay pigeon trap manufacturer. All I have got to do is flick that and press the button. Yup, ready,let&#39;s go. On your marks. Have you got a cartridge? Get set. You haven&#39;t got a cartridge have you? Go.</caption>
	<caption start="800">Yes! [Laughter] Browning clearly ahead of Bowman. Now its the turn of the insurance and car sales man. Nice of you to turn up. Thanks Charlie. [laughter] Explain to viewers what you do with your job. I am an NFU Mutual insurance agent and the local group secretary for the Aylesbury branch of the National Farmers Union. Terrific Martin what do you do? I look after the Land Rover dealership in Cheltenham.</caption>
	<caption start="828">Right that&#39;s where you are both wrong because you Simon are going to look after the Land Rover dealership by riding this Land Rover bicycle up that hill and you Martin are going to explain the benefits of NFU insurance to Simon while he does it. Are you ready? No. On your marks, get set, go. Right then Simon life insurance, health insurance.. Health insurance definitely Oh that&#39;s it. [Laughter] I think we have a winner in Martin.</caption>
	<caption start="856">Right back to your original positions Simon&#39;s fromthe NFU and you Martin are going to get up that hill in the manner that most typifies a Land Rover driver. Fantastic.</caption>
	<caption start="883">Does it mean its going to break down half way up? Go! Oh Martin! [Laughter] Land Rover of Cheltenham a winner there! Derek Barnes of Sporting Shooter magazine finds himself giving a shooting lesson to the Oxford Gun Company&#39;s Doug Florent, while Doug triesto sell advertising to Derek. Hello Mr Florent I am Derek Barnes from the Oxford Gun Company. Welcome to my shooting ground have you been shooting before? No. No? You haven&#39;t Are you married? No. I think I am going to leave these two to get on with it. Have you got children? Er no. Unfortunately that would have helped. I am actually a bachelor. I am actually advertising for a wife at this moment. Are you trying to pitch me some advertising space. No not at all.</caption>
	<caption start="908">Well don&#39;t do that now I&#39;m trying to teach you how to shoot. We&#39;ll call that a draw. Meanwhile back to the schools challenge and Doug&#39;s son David is racing around organising the clays. So 185 kids today. Is that a success? Yes, my aim is to try and beat 180 and we beat 180.</caption>
	<caption start="934">That&#39;s what we wanted to get in for each of the events so that&#39;s a success and the best thing that&#39;s done today is we&#39;vehad probably three or four of the schools are new schools first competition they have ever come into, so that&#39;s what the sixth Schools Challenge is there for. And we have also had individuals we have had an increase of individuals coming on their own which has only just started as well, so some of the old schools haven&#39;t come because it&#39;s been full, but it has come up with new schools that have never shot before. Can&#39;t really argue with that.</caption>
	<caption start="962">That&#39;s whatit is there for. One of the UK&#39;s top junior shooters is Amber Hill. It should not have gone well for you should it because you are moving to another sport. Not exactly yes. I am doing Olympic skeet now, because I&#39;ve just gone to Italy and got a new gun with my sponsors for it, so I have been practising with that. And how did you do today? I didn&#39;t shoot too bad I thought I would do worse than I did.</caption>
	<caption start="989">But I got a 46 I think outof 50 I think. A 46, well that&#39;s not bad. Do you think you could be in with a chance? Well I think Taylor Hedgecock has got a 47 and he did really really well so, but hopefully for the ladies I&#39;ll have a chance. Well that&#39;s not bad considering you are training now in Olympic skeet. Yeah I was really happy with it. At last the prize giving. Will Ford is prep winner with Isabella Ford ladies prep winner.</caption>
	<caption start="1018">Top ladies team is Millfield in Somerset while Amber Hill wins the ladies individual prize. Boys winner is Taylor Hedgecock from the Soham Village College in Cambridgeshire and Bloxham School goes away with a senior team prize. From fledgling shots to a fully grown crow man. It&#39;s Andy Crow with Sporting Shooter editor Dom Holtam. Today we are going to make some noise before we get anywhere near a shotgun.</caption>
	<caption start="1046">This stringof bangers is hopefully going to keep those pigeons moving around the farm and deny them a quiet place to settle away from our hide. You can buy these. We get them from our local agricultural supplier they usually go off every 20 minutes half hour, depends on the wind and where you put them really. I usually put them back out of the wind so they don&#39;t burn too quick. Sometimes I even cut them in half, cut the strings in half.</caption>
	<caption start="1076">I just cut the strings in half and hang them up together so that they go off more regularlyor have two strings running. But today we are not going to need the whole string so I shall probably cut off the bottom, the four off the bottom and that will keep us going for a couple or three hours we&#39;ll be shooting, but you must remember to keep them dry otherwise they don&#39;t start. You just want to hold it into the wind to make sure it does get going. You can see it&#39;s glowing now. It&#39;s getting up there. It&#39;s getting a bit of ash on there.</caption>
	<caption start="1109">The plan is to get over the other side and get set up before the bangers start going off. Of course you should never hang a string of explosives near any footpaths or public rights of way. Andy recommends that you never use them in the summer when the vegetation is dry. He has got enough to deal with without setting his crops on fire.</caption>
	<caption start="1136">When the charge is set it is time to get ready on the wheat field beneath some favoured sitty trees andfor a change he is using a mix of decoys. I tend to use fresh, not all the time. People I haven&#39;t always got fresh. I have been given these by A1 Decoys. They are flock coated and to tell you the truth they don&#39;t look too bad. The problem with old plastic decoys they used to shine all the time, but as you can see with these they have got like a velvety feel to them.</caption>
	<caption start="1163">One thing I will say you wouldn&#39;twant to get them dirty. You would not want to chuck them in a bag with dirty stick and that. You want to look after them. They are the sort of decoy you want to look after. But they do look real, I put some out amongst the real ones cause they are a bit lighter than the real ones, hopefully they will see them a bit better. No I&#39;m quite impressed with them. With a distant boom going off every 30 minutes or so the woodies are being pushed around, but so far they are not decoying well.</caption>
	<caption start="1191">The stock doves on the other hand are coming ina treat. Yeah there are quite a lot of stock doves coming in here. They see the eating birds and are probably coming in to pick the last chips of these acorns there&#39;s been quite a few of them here, there&#39;s been lots of pigeons here. Pity the pigeons have been a bit scarce today. Bit of a Mark Gilchrist day today. Haven&#39;t shot too many.</caption>
	<caption start="1216">Rock doves is another one which is protected, I dare say there would be someone who would tell me otherwise butthey are protected. But there are not the number of those as there are wood pigeons. Where wood pigeons you get thousands of them you&#39;ll probably get 20 or 30 stock doves. Andy doesn&#39;t just shoot he enjoys another great passion of mine, fishing and he&#39;s off for the first day of the trout season at nearby Bewl Water, the reservoir of choice if the news wants to show how little rain we have had. Hopefully we shouldn&#39;t get pestered by bank anglers because they won&#39;t be able to wade through the mud.</caption>
	<caption start="1243">No. It&#39;s more drought than trout. Yeah. Do you do you fish up there often? No, it&#39;s too expensive. I&#39;m not rich like you. GBP65 for a boat isn&#39;t it? Yeah. That&#39;s a fair old wodge of dosh. Yeah.</caption>
	<caption start="1271">When you think my favourite water up north is GBP3 for a day ticket and me and a matehave caught over a 100 trout before lunch there before. What was that with a net? No he was called Alistair. [laughter] There is plenty more where that came from. Anyway back to the pigeons and Crowman shifts up a gear.</caption>
	<caption start="1296">The speed and agility of these birds means most shots are a challenge, especially whenyou are leaving them late for the camera. Andy nearly takes this one on the chin and when they are coming in at that speed they can really hurt. With birds on the ground but with no dog by his side, Andy unleashes his other pedigree retriever, incredibly pigeons are still feeding on acorns which would normally be hovered up before Christmas.</caption>
	<caption start="1324">At least at the moment it is diverting their attention away fromthe crops, but that won&#39;t last for very much longer.
